The files in {src,include}/dbapi/driver/ftds*/freetds (except for the
makefiles, which NCBI wrote) are distributed under the GNU Library
General Public License; for more details, see the file
src/dbapi/driver/ftds/freetds/COPYING.LIB and the copyright notices in
the individual FreeTDS source files.  Likewise for Flek, in
{src,include}/gui/widgets/Flek.

The files in {src,include}/gui/widgets/Flek (excepting the Makefiles,
which were written an NCBI) are distributed under the GNU General Public
License.  Minor modifications have been made to these files, and these
changes are indicated at the top of each file as part of the CVS log.

The "configure" script was generated by GNU Autoconf, and contains the
following notice:
# Copyright 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002

# This configure script is free software; the Free Software Foundation
# gives unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.

The same goes for the auxiliary files "config.guess" and "config.sub"
provided that you distribute them as part of the toolkit; on their
own, they fall under the terms of the GNU General Public License [gpl.txt].

The files in {src,include}/util/regexp (again, with the exception of
NCBI-written makefiles) are Philip Hazel's PCRE library, distributed
under a BSD/MIT-style license; for more details, see the file
