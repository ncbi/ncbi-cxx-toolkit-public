<h3><a name="Object_manager"></a>
 Object manager.</h3>
      Object manager manages data objects, provides them to Scopes when needed.
   It knows all existing Data sources and Data loaders. When a Scope needs
 one,  it receives a data object from the Object Manager. This enables sharing
 and  reusing of all relevant data between different Scopes. Another function
 of  the Object Manager is letting Scopes know each other, letting Scopes
to communicate.  This is a barely visible entity.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Scope"></a>
 Scope.</h3>
      Scope is a top-level object available to a client. Its purpose is to
 define   a scope of visibility and reference resolution and provide access
 to the  bio sequence data.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Data_loader"></a>
 Data loader.</h3>
      Data loader is a link between in-process data storage and remote, out-of
   process data source. Its purpose is to communicate with a remote data
source,    receive data from there, understand what is already received and
what is   missing, and pass data to the local storage (Data source). Data
loader maintains   its own index of what data is loaded already and references
that data in  the Data source.      
<h3><a name="Data_source"></a>
 Data source.</h3>
      Data source stores bio sequence data locally. Scope communicates with 
 this  object to obtain any sequence data. Data source creates and maintains 
 internal  index to facilitate information search. Data source may contain 
 data of several  top-level <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQSET.HTML">
      Seq_entries</a>
      . In case client pushes an externally constructed Seq_entry object
in  the  Scope, such object is stored in a separate Data source. In this
case  Data  source has only one top-level Seq_entry. From the other side,
when Data source  is linked to a Data loader, it will contain all top-level
Seq_entries   retrieved  by that loader.      
<h3><a name="Bioseq_handle"></a>
 Bioseq handle.</h3>
      Bioseq handle is a kind of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/BIOSEQ.HTML">
      Bioseq</a>
       proxy. Its purpose is to facilitate access to Bioseq data. When client 
  wants to access particular biological sequence, it requests a Bioseq handle 
  from the Scope. <br>
   
<h3><a name="Bioseq_core"></a>
 Bioseq core.</h3>
      Bioseq core is partially populated Bioseq, or, better say, Bioseq as
 it  is loaded at the moment.      
<h3><a name="Seq_map"></a>
 Seq map.</h3>
      Seq map contains a general information about the sequence &#8211; location
 and   type of data only.      
<h3><a name="Seq_vector"></a>
 Seq vector.</h3>
      Seq vector contains sequence data only.      
<h3><a name="Description_iterator"></a>
 Description iterator.</h3>
      Description iterator traverses bio sequence descriptions (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/BIOSEQ.HTML">
      Seq_descr</a>
      ) in the Seq_entry. It starts with the description(s) of requested
sequence    (Bioseq) and then retrieves all sequence descriptions iterating
through  the  tree nodes up to the top-level Seq_entry. Starting Bioseq is
defined  by sequence  id (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQLOC.HTML">
      Seq_id</a>
      ). Descriptions do not contain information about what Bioseq they describe,
   so the only way to figure it out is by description location on the tree.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Annotation_iterator"></a>
 Annotation iterator.</h3>
      Annotation iterators are utility classes for traversing sequence annotation
   data. Each annotation contains a reference to one or more regions on one
  or more sequences (Bioseq). From one point of view this is good, because
 we can always say which sequences are related to the given annotation. From
 the other point of view, this creates a lot of problems, since an annotation
 referencing the sequence may be stored in another sequence/Seq_entry/tree.
 The annotation iterators attempt to find all objects related to the given
 location in all Data sources from the current Scope. Data sources create
indexes for all annotations by their locations.<br>
      There are three specialized annotation iterator classes:<br>
   
<ul>
       
  <li>Feature  iterator &#8211; traverses sequence features (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQFEAT.HTML">
      Seq_feat</a>
      );</li>
       
  <li>Graph data iterator  &#8211; traverses sequence graphs (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQRES.HTML">
      Seq_graph</a>
      ); </li>
       
  <li>Alignment iterator  &#8211; traverses sequence alignments descriptions (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQALIGN.HTML">
      Seq_align</a>
      ).</li>
   
</ul>
