<h2>
Overview</h2>
The
<a href="../libs.html#ref_TableDBAPI_DRIVER"><i>NCBI DBAPI driver</i> library</a>
describes and implements a set of objects needed to provide a
uniform low-level access to the various relational database management
systems (RDBMS). The basic driver functionality is the same as in most
other RDBMS client APIs. It allows to open a connection to a server, execute
a command (query) on this connection and get the results back. The main
advantage of using the driver is that you don't have to change your own
upper-level code if you need to move from one RDBMS client API to another.
<p>The driver can use two different methods to access the particular RDBMS.
If RDBMS provides a client library for a given computer system (i.e. Sun/Solaris),
then driver utilizes this library. If there is no client library, then
driver connects to RDBMS through a special <i>gateway server</i> which
is running on a computer system where such library does exist.


<a name="ref_DriverArch"></a>
<h2>
The driver architecture</h2>
There are two major groups of the driver's objects: the RDBMS independent
objects, and the objects which are specific to a particular RDBMS. The
only RDBMS specific object which user should be aware of is a "Driver Context".
The "Driver Context" is effectively a "Connection" factory. The only way
to make a connection to the server is to call the <i>Connect()</i> method
of a "Driver context" object. So, before doing anything with RDBMS, you
need to create at least one driver context object. All driver contexts
implement the same interface defined in <a href="../docxx/I_DriverContext.html">I_DriverContext</a>
class. If you are working on a library which could be used with various
RDBMS it is a good idea do not create the driver context inside the library,
but take a pointer to
<a href="../lxr/ident?i=I_DriverContext&d=C">I_DriverContext</a>
instead. There is no factory for the driver contexts provided. The reason
for that is it's not always possible to statically link in one binary the
RDBMS libraries from the different vendors. Most of them are written in
C and the name collisions do exist.
<p>The driver context creates the connection which is RDBMS specific, but
before return it to the caller it puts it into an "envelope" of RDBMS independent
object <a href="../docxx/CDB_Connection.html">CDB_Connection</a>.
The same is true for the commands and for the results - user gets the pointer
to RDBMS independent "envelope object" instead of the real one. This is
a caller responsibility to delete those objects. The life spans of the
real object and the envelope one are not necessarily the same.
<p>Once you have got the connection object, you could use it as a factory
for the different types of commands. The command object in it's turn serves
as a factory for the results. The connection is always single threaded,
that means that you have to execute the commands and process their results
sequentially one by one. If you need to execute the several commands in
parallel, you can do it using multiple connections.
<p>Another important part of the driver is an error and message handling.
There are two different mechanisms implemented. The first one is exceptions.
All exceptions which could be thrown by the driver are inherited from the
single base class <a href="../docxx/CDB_Exception.html">CDB_Exception</a>.
Driver uses the exception mechanism whenever it's possible, but in many
cases the underlying client library uses the callbacks or handlers to report
the error messages and prevents from throwing the exceptions. The driver
supply a handler's stack mechanism to manage these cases.
<p>To send and to receive the data through the driver you have to use the
driver provided datatypes. The collection of the datatypes includes: <a href="../docxx/CDB_TinyInt.html">one</a>,
<a href="../docxx/CDB_SmallInt.html">two</a>,
<a href="../docxx/CDB_Int.html">four</a>
and <a href="../docxx/CDB_BigInt.html">eight</a>
		byte integers; <a href="../docxx/CDB_Float.html">float</a>
and <a href="../docxx/CDB_Double.html">double</a>;
<a href="../docxx/CDB_Numeric.html">numeric</a>;
<a href="../docxx/CDB_Char.html">char</a>,
<a href="../docxx/CDB_VarChar.html">varchar</a>,
<a href="../docxx/CDB_Binary.html">binary</a>,
<a href="../docxx/CDB_VarBinary.html">varbinary</a>;
<a href="../docxx/CDB_DateTime.html">datetime</a>
and <a href="../docxx/CDB_SmallDateTime.html">smalldatetime</a>;
<a href="../docxx/CDB_Text.html">text</a>
and <a href="../docxx/CDB_Image.html">image</a>.
All datatypes are derived from a single base class <a href="../docxx/CDB_Object.html">CDB_Object</a>.

<h2>
Sample program</h2>
This program opens one connection to the server and selects the database
names and the date when each database was created (assuming that table
"sysdatabases" does exist). In this example the string "XXX" should be
replaced with the real driver name.
<pre>#include &lt;iostream>
#include &lt;dbapi/driver/public.hpp>

        CXXXContext my_context;

        // connecting to server "MyServer"
        // with user name "my_user_name" and password "my_password"
        CDB_Connection* con = my_context.Connect("MyServer", "my_user_name",
                                                 "my_password", 0);

<h3>
Error handling</h3>
The error handling is almost always a pain when you are working with RDBMS.
The different systems implement the different approaches. You could get
the error messages through the return codes, callbacks, handlers and/or
exceptions. These messages could have a different formats. It could be
just integer (error code) or some structure or a set of callback's arguments.
The <i>NCBI DBAPI driver</i> intercepts all those error messages in all
different formats and converts them into the objects of
<a href="../docxx/CDB_Exception.html">CDB_Exception</a>
derived types. The following types are used:
<dl>
<dt>
<a href="../docxx/CDB_SqlEx.html">CDB_SQLEx</a></dt>

<dd>
This type is used if error message has come from a SQL server and indicates
an error in SQL query. It could be a wrong table or column name or just
a wrong syntax of SQL query. The message details could be obtained using
the following methods:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<i>OriginatedFrom()</i> - returns a SQL server name</li>

<li>
<i>BatchLine()</i> - returns a line number in SQL batch which did generate an
error</li>

<li>
<i>Message()</i> - returns the error message itself</li>

<li>
<i>Severity()</i> - returns the severity of this message (assigned by SQL server)</li>

<li>
<i>ErrCode()</i> - returns the integer code for this message (assigned by SQL
server)</li>

<li>
<i>SqlState()</i> - returns a byte string describing an error (it's not useful
most of the time)</li>
</ul>

<dt>
<a href="../docxx/CDB_RPCEx.html">CDB_RPCEx</a></dt>

<dd>
An error message has come while RPC or stored procedure was executed on
a server. The methods to use:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<i>OriginatedFrom()</i> - returns a server name</li>

<li>
<i>ProcName()</i> - returns a procedure name</li>

<li>
<i>ProcLine()</i> - returns a line number inside the procedure</li>

<li>
<i>Message()</i> - returns the error message itself</li>

<li>
<i>Severity()</i> - returns the severity of this message (assigned by a server)</li>

<li>
<i>ErrCode()</i> - returns the integer code for this message (assigned by a server)</li>
</ul>

<dt>
<a href="../docxx/CDB_DeadlockEx.html">CDB_DeadlockEx</a></dt>

<dd>
To report about deadlock. The methods to use:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<i>OriginatedFrom()</i> - returns a SQL server name</li>

<li>
<i>Message()</i> - returns the error message itself</li>
</ul>

<dt>
<a href="../docxx/CDB_DSEx.html">CDB_DSEx</a></dt>

<dd>
Any error which has come from a RDBMS and is not a SQL query or RPC related.
The methods to use:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<i>OriginatedFrom()</i> - returns a server name</li>

<li>
<i>Message()</i> - returns the error message itself</li>

<li>
<i>Severity()</i> - returns the severity of this message (assigned by a server)</li>

<li>
<i>ErrCode()</i> - returns the integer code for this message (assigned by a server)</li>
</ul>

<dt>
<a href="../docxx/CDB_TimeoutEx.html">CDB_TimeoutEx</a></dt>

<dd>
To report about timeout. The methods to use:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<i>OriginatedFrom()</i> - returns a server name</li>

<li>
<i>Message()</i> - returns the error message itself</li>
</ul>

<dt>
<a href="../docxx/CDB_ClientEx.html">CDB_ClientEx</a></dt>

<dd>
Any client side error. The methods to use:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<i>OriginatedFrom()</i> - returns the name of method or function which reports
the error</li>

<li>
<i>Message()</i> - returns the error message itself</li>

<li>
<i>Severity()</i> - returns the severity of this message</li>

<li>
<i>ErrCode()</i> - returns the integer code for this message</li>
</ul>
</dl>
Driver uses two ways to deliver the error message object to an application.
If it is possible to <b>throw</b> an exception, then driver throws the
error message object. If not, then driver calls the <a href="../docxx/CDB_UserHandler.html">user's
error handler</a> with a pointer to this object as an argument. It's not
always convenient to process all types of error messages in one error handler.
Some users may want to use a special error message handler inside some
function or block and a default error handler outside. To accommodate these
cases the driver provides a <a href="../lxr/ident?i=CDBHandlerStack&d=C">handler
stack mechanism</a>. The top handler in the stack gets the error message
object first. If it knows how to deal with this message, then it processes
the message and returns <b>true</b>. If handler wants to pass this message
to the other handlers, then it returns <b>false</b>. So, driver pushing
the error message object through the stack until it gets true from the
handler. The <a href="../docxx/CDB_UserHandler_Stream.html">default
driver's error handler</a> which just printout the error message to stderr
is always on a bottom of the stack. The another tool which user may want
to use for error handling is the <a href="../docxx/CDB_MultiEx.html">CDB_MultiEx</a>
objects. This tool allows to collect the multiple <a href="../docxx/CDB_Exception.html">CDB_Exception</a>
objects into one container and than <b>throw</b> this container as one
object.


<a name="ref_Context"></a>
<h3>
Driver context and connections</h3>
Every program which is going to work with <i>NCBI DBAPI driver</i> should
create at least one Driver Context object first. The main purpose of this
object is to be a Connection factory, but it's a good idea to customize
this object a little bit prior to open any connection. The first step is
to setup two message handler stacks. The first one is for error messages
which are not bound to some particular connection or could occur inside
the
<i>Connect()</i> method. Use <i>PushCntxMsgHandler()</i> to populate
it. The other stack serves as a initial message handler stack for all connections
which will be derived from this context. Use <i>PushDefConnMsgHandler()</i>
method to populate this stack. The second step of customization is a time-outs
setting. The <i>SetLoginTimeout()</i> and <i>SetTimeout()</i> methods do
the job. If you are going to work with text or image objects in your program,
you need to call <i>SetMaxTextImageSize()</i> to define the maximal size
for such objects. Objects which exceed this limit could be truncated.
<pre>
class CMyHandlerForConnectionBoundErrors : public CDB_UserHandler
{
    virtual bool HandleIt(CDB_Exception* ex);
    ...
};

class CMyHandlerForOtherErrors : public CDB_UserHandler
{
    virtual bool HandleIt(CDB_Exception* ex);
    ...
};

...
int main()
{
    CMyHandlerForConnectionBoundErrors conn_handler;
    CMyHandlerForOtherErrors           other_handler;
    ...
    try { // to be sure that we are catching all driver related exceptions 

        // We need to create a driver context first
        // In real program we have to replace CXXXContext with something real
        CXXXContext my_context;
        my_context.PushCntxMsgHandler(&amp;other_handler);
        my_context.PushDefConnMsgHandler(&amp;conn_handler);
        // set timeouts (in seconds) and size limits (in bytes):
        my_context.SetLoginTimeout(10); // for logins
        my_context.SetTimeout(15);      // for client/server communications
        my_context.SetMaxTextImageSize(0x7FFFFFFF); // text/image size limit
        ...
        CDB_Connection* my_con =
            my_context.Connect("MyServer", "my_user_name", "my_password",
                               I_DriverContext::fBcpIn);
        ...
    }
    catch (CDB_Exception&amp; e) {
        other_handler.HandleIt(&amp;e);
    }
}
</pre>
The only way to get a connection to a server in <i>NCBI DBAPI driver</i>
is through a <i>Connect()</i> method in <a href="../docxx/I_DriverContext.html">driver
context</a>. The first three arguments: server name, user name and password
are obvious. Values for <i>mode</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive-OR
of flags defined in EConnectionMode. If <i>reusable</i> is <b>false</b>,
then driver creates a new connection which will be destroyed as soon as
user delete the correspondent <a href="../lxr/ident?i=CDB_Connection&d=C">CDB_Connection</a>
(the <i>pool_name</i> is ignored in this case).
<p>Opening a connection to a server is an expensive operation. If program
opens and closes connections to the same server multiple times it worth
to call the <i>Connect()</i> method with <i>reusable</i> set to <b>true</b>.
In this case driver does not close the connection when the correspondent
CDB_Connection is deleted, but keeps it around in a "recycle bin". Every
time an application calls the <i>Connect()</i> method with <i>reusable</i>
set to <b>true</b>, driver tries to satisfy the request from a "recycle
bin" first and opens a new connection only if it is necessary.
<p>The <i>pool_name</i> argument is just an arbitrary string. Application
could use this argument to assign a name to one or more connections (to
create a connection pool) or to invoke a connection by name from this pool.
<pre>    ...
    // Create a pool of four connections (two to one server and two to another)
    // with the default database "DatabaseA"
    CDB_Connection* con[4];
    int i;
    for (i = 4;  i--; ) {
        con[i]= my_context.Connect((i%2 == 0) ? "MyServer1" : "MyServer2", 
                                   "my_user_name", "my_password", 0, true,
                                   "ConnectionPoolA");
        CDB_LangCmd* lcmd= con[i]->LangCmd("use DatabaseA");
        lcmd->Send();
        while(lcmd->HasMoreResults()) {
            CDB_Result* r = lcmd->Result();
            delete r;
        }
        delete lcmd;
    }
    // return all connections to a "recycle bin"
    for(i= 0; i &lt; 4; delete con_array[i++]);
    ...

    // in some other part of the program
    // we want to get a connection from "ConnectionPoolA"
    // but we don't want driver to open a new connection if pool is empty
    try {
        CDB_Connection* my_con= my_context.Connect("", "", "", 0, true,
                                                   "ConnectionPoolA");
        // Note that server name, user name and password are empty
        ...
    }
    catch (CDB_Exception&amp; e) {
        // the pool is empty
        ...
    }
</pre>

Application could combine in one pool the connections to the different
servers. This mechanism could also be used to group together the connections
with some particular settings (default database, transaction isolation
level, etc.).

<a name="ref_TextImage"></a>
<h3>
Text and Image Data Handling</h3>
The <b>text</b> and <b>image</b> are SQL datatypes which can hold up to
2Gb of data. Because they could be huge, RDBMS keep these values separately
from the other data in the table. In most cases the table itself keeps
just a special pointer to a text/image value and an actual value occupies
a separate disk space. This implicates some difficulties in text/image
data handling.
<p>When you retrieves a large text/image value, you often prefer to "stream"
it into your program and process it chunk by chunk rather than get it as
one piece. Some RDBMS clients allow to stream the text/image values only
if a correspondent column is the only column in select statement.
<p>Let's suppose that you do have a table:
<br>table T (i_val int, t_val text)
<br>And you need to select all i_val, t_val where i_val > 0.
<br>The simplest way is to use a query:
<pre><i>select</i> i_val, t_val <i>from</i> T <i>where</i> i_val > 0</pre>
But it could be expensive. Because two columns are selected, some clients
will put the whole row in a buffer prior to give the access to it to the
user. The better way to do this is to use two selects:
<pre><i>select</i> i_val <i>from</i> T <i>where</i> i_val > 0
<i>select</i> t_val <i>from</i> T <i>where</i> i_val > 0</pre>
Looks ugly, but could save you a lot of memory.
<p>Updating and inserting the text/image data is also not a straightforward
process. For small texts and images it is possible to use just SQL <i>insert</i>
and <i>update</i> statements, but it will be inefficient (if possible at
all) for the large ones. The better ways to insert and to update the texts
and images is to use <i>SendData()</i> method of <a href="../lxr/ident?i=CDB_Connection&d=C">CDB_Connection</a>
object or to use the
<a href="../lxr/ident?i=CDB_SendDataCmd&d=C">CDB_SendDataCmd</a>
object.
<p>Recommended algorithm for inserting the text/image data:
<ul>
<li>
Using a SQL <i>insert</i> statement insert a new row into a table. Use
<b>" "</b> value for each <i>text</i> column (<b>0x0</b> for <i>image</i>
column) you are going to populate. Use <b>NULL</b> only if this value is
going to remain <b>NULL</b>.</li>

<li>
Using a SQL <i>select</i> statement select all text/image columns from
this row.</li>

<li>
Fetch the row result and get a I_ITDescriptor for each column</li>

<li>
Finish the results loop</li>

<li>
Use <i>SendData()</i> method or <a href="../docxx/CDB_SendDataCmd.html">CDB_SendDataCmd</a>
object to populate the columns.</li>
</ul>
<b>Example</b>
<p>Let's suppose that we want to insert a new row into table T described
above.
<pre>CDB_Connection* con;
...
// preparing the query
CDB_LangCmd* lcmd= con->LangCmd("insert T (i_val, t_val) values(100, ' ')\n");
lcmd->More("select t_val from T where i_val = 100");

// Sending this query to a server
lcmd->Send();

I_ITDescriptor* my_descr;

// the result loop
while(lcmd->HasMoreResults()) {
    CDB_Result* r= lcmd->Result();
    // skip all but row result
    if (r == 0  ||  r->ResultType() != eDB_RowResult) {
        delete r;
        continue;
    }
    // fetching the row
    while(r->Fetch()) {
        // read 0 bytes from the text (some clients need this trick)
        r->ReadItem(0, 0);

        my_deskr = r->GetImageOrTextDescriptor();
    }
    delete r; // we don't need this result anymore
}

delete lcmd; // delete the command

CDB_Text my_text;
my_text.Append("This is a text I want to insert");

//sending the text
con->SendData(my_descr, my_text);

delete my_descr; // we don't need this descriptor anymore
...</pre>
Recommended algorithm for updating the text/image data:
<ul>
<li>
Using a SQL <i>update</i> statement replace the current value with <b>"
"</b> for text column (<b>0x0</b> for image)</li>

<li>
Using a SQL <i>select</i> statement select all text/image columns you want
to update in this row.</li>

<li>
Fetch the row result and get a I_ITDescriptor for each column</li>

<li>
Finish the results loop</li>

<li>
Use <i>SendData()</i> method or <a href="../docxx/CDB_SendDataCmd.html">CDB_SendDataCmd</a>
object to populate the columns.</li>
</ul>
<b>Example</b>
<pre>CDB_Connection* con;
...
// preparing the query
CDB_LangCmd* lcmd= con->LangCmd("update T set t_val= ' ' where i_val =  100");
lcmd->More("select t_val from T where i_val = 100");

// Sending this query to a server
lcmd->Send();

I_ITDescriptor* my_descr;

// the result loop
while(lcmd->HasMoreResults()) {
    CDB_Result* r= lcmd->Result();
    // skip all but row result
    if (r == 0  ||  r->ResultType() != eDB_RowResult) {
        delete r;
        continue;
    }
    // fetching the row
    while(r->Fetch()) {
        // read 0 bytes from the text (some clients need this trick)
        r->ReadItem(0, 0);

        my_deskr = r->GetImageOrTextDescriptor();
    }
    delete r; // we don't need this result anymore
}

delete lcmd; // delete the command

CDB_Text my_text;
my_text.Append("This is a text I want to see as an update");

//sending the text
con->SendData(my_descr, my_text);

delete my_descr; // we don't need this descriptor anymore
...
</pre>

<h3>
Results loop</h3>
The connection in <i>NCBI DBAPI driver</i> is always single threaded.
Application has to retrieve all results from a current command prior to executing a new one.
Not all of the results are always meaningful for the application (i.e. an RPC always
returns a status result regardles of either a procedure has a "<em>return</em> something" statement or not),
but all of them need to be retrieved. The following results loop is recommended for all types of the commands:
<pre>
CDB_XXXCmd* cmd; // XXX could be Lang, RPC, etc.
...
while (cmd-&gt;HasMoreResults()) {
        // HasMoreResults() method returns <b>true</b>
        // if the Result() method needs to be called.
        // It doesn't guarantee that Result() will return not NULL result

   CDB_Result* res = cmd-&gt;Result();
   if (res == 0)
       continue; // a NULL res doesn't mean that there is no more results

   switch(res-&gt;ResultType()) {
      case eDB_RowResult: // row result 
          while(res-&gt;Fetch()) {
             ...
          }
          break;
      case eDB_ParamResult: // Output parameters
          while(res-&gt;Fetch()) {
             ...
          }
          break;
      case eDB_ComputeResult: // Compute result
          while(res-&gt;Fetch()) {
             ...
          }
          break;
      case eDB_StatusResult: // Status result
          while(res-&gt;Fetch()) {
             ...
          }
          break;
      case eDB_CursorResult: // Cursor result
          while(res-&gt;Fetch()) {
             ...
          }
          break;
   }
   delete res;
}
</pre>

If you don't want to process some particular type of result, just skip the <b>while</b>(res-&gt;Fetch()){...}
in the corresponding <b>case</b>.
