  Here we define Object Manager's internal classes and their behavior. Internal
 classes should never be used by a client program directly.<br>

<h3><a name="Seq_id_Handle"></a>
 Seq_id handle.</h3>
     Seq_id handle is an internal object, which is used as an alias (or substitute) 
  to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQLOC.HTML">
 Seq_id</a>
 . Due to complex nature of Seq_id, it is replaced by this lightweight object. 
<br>
 
<h3><a name="Seq_id_Mapper"></a>
 Seq_id mapper.</h3>
  Seq_id mapper maps Seq_id to Seq_id handle, back and forth. Such map is 
unique for each Object Manager - hence it is created and maintained by it. 
Different Object Managers have  different maps. The map is populated when 
the data is loaded from various data sources. For each Seq_id the mapper creates
the handle if necessary.<br>
 
<h3><a name="Bioseq_Info"></a>
  Bioseq info.</h3>
   Bioseq info object stores the set of &nbsp;Seq_id handles which identify 
the biological sequence, as well as a reference to the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQSET.HTML">
 Seq_entry</a>
  which contains the sequence. Since all such Seq_id handles refer to the 
same bio sequence, they are called synonyms here. 
<h3><a name="TSE_Info"></a>
 Top-level seq entry info.</h3>
 Top-level seq entry (TSE) info object stores a map of Seq_id handles to
corresponding Bioseq info objects as well as a reference to the TSE which
it describes. Another information stored here is a map of &nbsp;Seq_id handles
to annotation maps which list all annotation objects for the sequence.<br>
 
<h3><a name="AnnotObject"></a>
 Annotation object.</h3>
  Annotation object is a substitute to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/BIOSEQ.HTML">
 Seq_annot</a>
 . It is used to facilitate the search for annotations which refer to a proper 
location on the sequence.<br>
 
<h3><a name="Annot_CI"></a>
 Annotation iterator (TSE).</h3>
 While "regular" annotation iterator enumerates all annotations for a given 
sequence in the Scope, this iterator traverses only annotations within a given
top-level Seq_entry. In fact "regular" iterator uses this one in its work.<br>
 
<h3><a name="HandleRange"></a>
 Handle range.</h3>
  Handle range contains list of ranges (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CRange">
 CRange</a>
 ) for a particular Bioseq handle. It facilitates the search for annotations 
on the bio sequence.<br>
 
<h3><a name="HandleRangeMap"></a>
 Handle range map.</h3>
  Handle range map maps Bioseq handle to Handle range. It serves as a substitution 
for <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQLOC.HTML">
 Seq_loc</a>
  and is used by annotation iterators<br>
