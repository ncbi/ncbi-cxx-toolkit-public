<h2>Requirements.</h2>
    Client must be able to analyze biological sequence data, which come from
   multiple heterogeneous data sources. As for &#8220;standard&#8221; databases, we mean
   only NCBI GENBANK. &#8220;Nonstandard&#8221; data source may include but are not limited
   to reading data from file or constructing bio sequence &#8220;manually&#8221;.<br>
<br>
      The purpose of biologist could be to investigate different combinations 
  of data pieces. The system should provide for transparent merge of different
   pieces of data, as well as various combinations of it. Important thing
to   note is that such combinations may be incorrect or ambiguous. It is
one of  the possible goals of client to discover such ambiguity.<br>
<br>
      The bio sequence data may be huge. Querying this vast amount of data
 from   a remote database may impose severe requirements on communication
lines and  computer resources &#8211; both client and server. The system should
provide for  partial data acquisition. In other words, the system should
only transmit   data that is really needed, not all of it at once. At the
same time this  technology should not impose additional (or too much) restrictions
on a client  system. The process, from a client point of view, should be
as transparent  as possible. When and if client needs more information, it
should be retrieved  "automatically".<br>
<br>
      Different biological sequences can refer to each other. One example 
of  such  reference may be in the form "the sequence of amino acids here is
the  same  as sequence of amino acids there" (what is the meaning of here
 and there is a separate question). The data retrieval system should be able
 to resolve  such references automatically answering what amino acids (or
nucleic acids) are actually here.  At the same time, at client request, such
automatic resolution may be turned  off. Probably, the client&#8217;s purpose is
to investigate such references.<br>
<br>
      Biological sequences are identified by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/SEQLOC.HTML">
Seq_id</a>
    , which may have different forms. Information about specific sequence 
stored  in the database  can be modified at any time. Sometimes, if changes 
are minor,  this only results  in creating a new submission of existing bio 
sequence and assigning a new  revision number to it. In case of more substantial 
changes  new version number  can be assigned. The data change, still, from 
client point of view the system  should provide consistency. Possible scenarios
 include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>   Database changes during client&#8217;s session. Client starts  working
  and retrieves some data from the database, the data in database then  change.
  When client then asks for an additional data, the system should retrieve
  original bio sequence submission data, not the most recent one.</li>
  <li>   Database changes between client&#8217;s sessions. Client retrieves   some 
data and ends work session. Next time the most recent submission data   is 
retrieved, unless the client asks for a specific version number.</li>
</ul>
<br>
      The system must support multithreading. It should be possible to work 
 with  bio sequence data from multiple threads.<br>
