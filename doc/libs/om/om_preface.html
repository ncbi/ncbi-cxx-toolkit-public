<h2>Preface.</h2>

<p>
Molecular biology is generating a vast multitude of data referring to our
understanding of the processes which underlie all living things. This data
is being accumulated and analyzed in thousands of laboratories all over
the  world. Its raw volume is growing at an astonishing rate.
</p>


<p>
In these circumstances the problem of storing, searching, retrieving and
exchanging molecular biology data cannot be underestimated.
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI</a>
maintains several databases for storing biomedical information. While
the amount of information stored in these databases grows at an exponential
rate, it becomes more and more important to optimize, improve the data retrieval
software tools. Object Manager is one of such tools specifically designed
to facilitate data retrieval.
</p>


<p>
The NCBI databases and software tools are designed around a particular
model of biological sequence data. The nature of this data is not yet fully
understood, its fundamental properties and relationships are constantly
being revised. So, the data model must be very flexible. NCBI uses
<a href="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/">Abstract Syntax Notation One</a>
(ASN.1) as a formal language to describe
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/SDKDOCS/INDEX.HTML">
biological sequence data and its associated information</a>.
