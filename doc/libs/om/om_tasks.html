<h3>Tasks.</h3>

<p>
We have compiled here a list of teaching examples to help you start working
with the C++ <var>Object Manager</var>. Completing them, getting your comments
and investigating the problems encountered would let us give warnings
of issues to deal with in the nearest future, better understand
what modifications should be made to this software system,
</p>
<p>
The main idea here is to build one task on the top of another, in growing
level of complexity:
<ol>
  <li>having sequence id (GI), get bio-sequence(Bioseq)</li>
  <li>print the sequence's title descriptor (Seqdesc.title),</li>
  <li>print the sequence's length</li>
  <li>print the sequence's SegMap structure</li>
  <li>print count of CdRegion features and their locations on the sequence</li>
  <li>calculate percentage of 'G' and 'C' symbols in the whole sequence</li>
  <li>calculate percentage of 'G' and 'C' symbols for regions within CdRegion features</li>
  <li>calculate percentage of 'G' and 'C' symbols for regions outside any CdRegion feature</li>
  <li>convert the application into a CGI one</li>
  <li>convert the application into a FCGI one</li>
</ol>
</p>






<h3>Test biosequences.</h3>
<p>
Below is the list of example sequences to use with the C++ toolkit
training course.
<br>
It starts with one Teaching Example that has one genomic nucleic acid
sequence and one protein with a CdRegion.
<br>
Following that is the list of Test Examples. Once the code is functioning
on the Teaching Example, we suggest running it through these. They
include a bunch of different conditions: short sequence with one CdRegion,
longer with 6 CdRegions, a protein record (this is an error, and code should recover),
segmented sequence, 8 megabase genomic contig, a popset member, and a draft
sequence with no CdRegions.
