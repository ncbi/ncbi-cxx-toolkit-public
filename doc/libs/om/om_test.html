<h1>Object Manager.</h1>

<h2>Test cases.</h2>
1.<br>
Create object manager as a referenced object in the heap (in CRef container).<br>
Create data loader 1 in the heap and register it with the object manager
as a non-default one.<br>
Create data loader 2 in the heap and register it with the object manager
as a default one.<br>
Create scope 1 as a referenced object in the heap.<br>
Add default data loaders to the scope 1 - only data loader 2 is added.<br>
Add data loader 1 to the scope 1 - now scope1 has two data loaders.<br>
Create scope 2 as an object on the stack.<br>
Add default data loaders to the scope 2 - only data loader 2 is added.<br>
Both scopes go out of scope - both scopes are deleted, both data loaders
are alive.<br>
Object manager goes out of scope - both data loaders are deleted.<br>
<br>
2.<br>
Create object manager as a referenced object in the heap.<br>
Create data loader 1 in the heap and register it with the object manager
as a default one.<br>
Create scope 1 in the heap.<br>
Add default data loaders to the scope 1.<br>
Delete scope - data loader 1 is alive.<br>
Object manager goes out of scope - data loader 1 is deleted.<br>
<br>
3.<br>
Create object manager as a referenced object in the heap.<br>
Create data loader 1 in the heap and register it with the object manager
as a default one.<br>
Create scope 1 as a referenced object in the heap.<br>
 Add default data loaders to the scope 1.<br>
Revoke data loader 1 in the object manager - the call fails: data loader
is in use.<br>
Scope goes out of scope - scope is deleted.<br>
Revoke data loader 1 in the object manager - the call succeeds.<br>
Revoke data loader 1 in the object manager - object manager generates an
exception: no such data loader.<br>
<br>
4.<br>
Create object manager as a referenced object in the heap.<br>
Create scope 1 as a referenced object in the heap.<br>
 Add default data loaders to the scope 1 - the call succeedes, no data loaders
added though,<br>
Add data loader 1 to the scope - object manager generates an exception: no
such data loader.<br>
<br>
5.<br>
Create object manager as a referenced object in the heap.<br>
Create scope on the stack.<br>
Add top level seq entry to the scope - a data source is created to store
the entry.<br>
Scope goes out of scope - the seq entry is deleted, the data source is deleted.<br>
<br>
6.<br>
