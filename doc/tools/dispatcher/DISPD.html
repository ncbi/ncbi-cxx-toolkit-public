<a name="ref_Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>

<tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> is a CGI/1.0-compliant program, the purpose of which
is to map requested service name to an actual server location,
when the client has no direct access to <a href="LBSMD.html"><tt>LBSMD</tt></a>.
This mapping is called <i>dispatching</i>. Optionally <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> can also pass data
between the client, requested the mapping, and the server, which implements the
service, and was found as a result of <i>dispatching</i>. This combined
mode is called <i>connection</i>. The client may choose either of these
modes if there is no special requirement on data transfer (e.g. firewall
connection). In some cases, however, the requested connection mode implicitly
limits the request to be a <i>dispatching</i>-only request, and actual
data flow between the client and the server occurs separately at a later stage.


<p><hr><p>

<a name="ref_Protocol"></a><h2>Protocol Description</h2>

Dispatching protocol is designed as an extension to HTTP/1.0 and is coded in the
HTTP header parts of the packets. The request (both <i>dispatching</i>
and <i>connection</i>) is done by sending an HTTP-packet to <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> with
a query line of the form:

<blockquote><tt><font color="#009900">dispd.cgi?service=<i>&lt;name></i></font></tt></blockquote>

which can be followed by parameters (if applicable) to be passed to the
service. <tt><i>&lt;Name></i></tt> defines the name of the service to be used.
The other parameters take form of one or more of the following construct:

<blockquote><tt><font color="#009900">&amp;<i>&lt;param></i>[=<i>&lt;value></i>]</font></tt></blockquote>

where square brackets are used to denote an optional value part of the
parameter.

<p>
In case of a <i>connection</i> request, the request body can contain
data to be passed to the first found server, connection to which is
automatically initiated by <tt>DISPD.GCI</tt> after <i>dispatching</i>. On a contrary,
in case of a <i>dispatching</i>-only request the body is completely ignored
(connection dropped) after the header has been read that may confuse
an unprepared client.

<p>
Mapping of service name into server address is done via <a href="LBSMD.html">LBSM Daemon
(<tt>LBSMD</tt>)</a>, which has to run on the exactly same host where
<tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> has started. <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> never
dispatches non-local client to a server marked as <i>local</i>-only (by means of
<a href="LBSMD.html#ref_Local"><tt>L=yes</tt></a> in configuration of <tt>LBSMD</tt>). Otherwise, the result
of dispatching is exactly what the client would get from <a href="../../libs/conn.html#ref_ServiceAPI">service
mapping API</a> if run locally. Explicitly specifying its capabilities, the client
can narrow the server search; for example, by choosing
<a href="#ref_Stateless">stateless</a> servers only.

<ul>

  <li>In the client request to <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> the following additional
  HTTP tags are recognized:

  <p>
  <tt><font color="#009900">Accepted-Server-Types:
  <i>&lt;list></i></font></tt>
  <br>where <tt><i>&lt;list></i></tt> can include
  one or more of the following keywords separated by spaces:
  <ul type="square">
    <li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">NCBID</font></tt></li>
    <li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">STANDALONE</font></tt></li>
    <li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">HTTP</font></tt></li>
    <li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">HTTP_GET</font></tt></li>
    <li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">HTTP_POST</font></tt></li>
    <li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">FIREWALL</font></tt></li>
    <br>which describe <a href="LBSMD.html#ref_ServerType">server types</a> the client is capable to handle.<br>
    Default is <i>any</i> (when the tag is not present at all in the HTTP header),
    and in case of <i>connection</i> request, the dispatcher will accomodate an actual
    found server with the connection mode, which the client requested, by relaying data
    appropriately, and in a way suitable for the server.<br>
    <u>Note</u>: <tt>FIREWALL</tt> indicates that the client has chosen a <a href="#ref_Communication">firewall
    way of communication</a>.<br>
    <u>Note</u>: Some server types can be ignored if not compatible with current
    <a href="#Client-Mode">client mode</a>.
  </ul>

  <p>
  <a NAME="Client-Mode"></a><tt><font color="#009900">Client-Mode:
  <i>&lt;client-mode></i></font></tt>
  <br>where <tt><i>&lt;client-mode></i></tt> can be one of the following:
  <ul type="square">
    <li><a name="ref_Stateless"></a><tt><font color="#CC33CC">STATELESS_ONLY</font></tt></li> -
    specifies that the client is not capable of
    doing full-duplex data exchange with the server (e.g. in a dedicated
    connection).
    <li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">STATEFUL_CAPABLE</font></tt></li> -
    should be used by the clients, which are
    capable of holding an open connection to a server. This keyword
    serves as a hint to dispatcher to try to open a direct TCP channel
    between the client and the server, thus reducing the network usage overhead.
  </ul>
  Default (when the tag is not present at all) is <tt>STATELESS_ONLY</tt> in order to support Web-browsers.

  <p>
  <tt><font color="#009900">Dispatch-Mode:
  <i>&lt;dispatch-mode></i></font></tt>
  <br>where <tt><i>&lt;dispatch-mode></i></tt> can be one of the following:
  <ul type="square">
    <li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">INFORMATION_ONLY</font></tt></li> - specifies that the request is a
    <i>dispatching</i> request, and no data and/or connection establishment
    with the server required at this stage. That is, <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> only returns
    a list of available server specifications (if any), corresponding
    to requested service, and in accordance with client mode and server acceptance.<br>
    <li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">NO_INFORMATION</font></tt></li> - is used to disable sending the above
    mentioned dispatching information back to the client.
    This keyword is reserved solely for internal use by <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> and
    should <i>not</i> be used by a side application.<br>
    <li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">STATEFUL_INCLUSIVE</font></tt></li> -
    informs <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> that current request is a <i>connection</i> request,
    and as soon as it is going over HTTP, it is treated as stateless, thus the
    dispatching would otherwise supply stateless servers only. This keyword modifies the
    default behavior, and dispatching information sent back along with
    server reply (resulting from data exchange) should include stateful
    servers as well, so allowing the client to go to a dedicated connection later.<br>
    <u>Note</u>: This keyword is not yet in use by present implementation of
    <a href="../../libs/conn.html#ref_ServiceConnector">service connector</a>.
  </ul>
  Default (in the absence of this tag) is <i>connection</i> request, and as it is going over HTTP,
  it is automatically considered stateless. This is to support calls for NCBI services from Web-browsers.

  <p>
  <tt><font color="#009900">Skip-Info-<i>n</i>: <i>&lt;server-info></i></font></tt>
  <br>A number of <i>&lt;server-info></i> strings can be passed to <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> to
  ignore the servers from being potential mapping targets
  (in case the client knows the listed servers either do not work or are not appropriate).
  <tt>Skip-Info</tt> tags are enumerated by numerical consequent suffices
  (<i>n</i>), starting from&nbsp;1. These tags are optional and should only be used
  if the client believes that the certain servers do not match the search
  criteria, or otherwise the client may end up with an unsuccessful mapping.

  <p>
  <tt><font color="#009900">Client-Host: <i>&lt;host></i></font></tt>
  <br>This tag is used by <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> internally to identify the <i>&lt;host></i>,
  where the request comes from, in case of relaying involved. Although <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt>
  should disregard this tag if the request originates from outside NCBI, and
  thus is not fooled by the address spoofing, inhouse applications should <i>not</i> use this
  tag when connecting to <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt>, because the tag <i>is</i> considered within the NCBI Intranet.

  <p>
  <li>
  In response to the client <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> can produce the following HTTP tags:

  <p>
  <tt><font color="#009900">Relay-Path: <i>&lt;path></i></font></tt>
  <br>the tag shows how the information was passed along by <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> and <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt>.
  This is essential for debugging purposes.

  <p>
  <tt><font color="#009900">Server-Info-<i>n</i>: <i>&lt;server-info></i></font></tt>
  <br>the tag(s) (enumerated increasingly by suffix <i>n</i>, starting from&nbsp;1) give a list of servers,
  where the requested service is available. The list can have up to&nbsp;5 entries. However,
  there only one entry generated, if the service was requested in <a href="#ref_Communication">firewall mode</a>
  or by a Web-browser. For non-local client the returned server descriptors can include <tt>FIREWALL</tt>
  server specifications. Despite preserving information about host, port, type and other (but not all)
  parameters of the original servers, <tt>FIREWALL</tt> descriptors are not specifications of real servers,
  but they are created on-the-fly by <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> to indicate that the connection point of the server
  cannot be otherwise reached without the use of <a href="#ref_Communication">either firewalling
  or relaying</a>). 

  <p>
  <a name="ref_ConnectionInfo"></a><tt><font color="#009900">Connection-Info: <i>&lt;host>&nbsp;&lt;port>&nbsp;&lt;ticket></i></font></tt>
  <br>the tag gets generated in a response to a stateful-capable client and includes host (in a dotted notation) and port number
  (decimal value) of the connection point where the server is listening on (if either the server has specifically started or the
  <a href="fwdaemon.html">firewall daemon</a> has created that connection point due to the client request).
  The ticket value (hexadecimal) represents the 4-byte ticket, which must be passed to the server as binary
  data in the very beginning of the stream. If instead of host, port and ticket
  information there is a keyword <tt><font color="#CC33CC">TRY_STATELESS</font></tt>, then for some reason
  (see <tt>Dispatcher-Failures:</tt> tag below) the request failed, but may succeed if the client would
  switch into stateless mode.

  <p>
  <tt><font color="#009900">Request-Failed: <i>&lt;reason></i></font></tt>
  <br>the tag (if present) means mapping failure with an explanation in the tag value.<br>
  <u>Note</u>: Dispatching failure is also indicated by an unsuccessful HTTP completion code.
  Reply body contains the error message, too.

  <p>
  <tt><font color="#009900">Dispatcher-Failures: <i>&lt;failures></i></font></tt>
  <br>the tag value lists all transient failures, which dispatcher might have expirienced while
  processing request. Fatal error may or may not appear as the last failure in the list,
  but should be mentioned in <tt>Request-Failed:</tt> tag if caused by mapping failure.

</ul>

<a name="ref_Communication"></a><h2>Communication Schemes</h2>

After making <i>dispatching</i> request and using the dispatching information returned,
often the client can connect to the server on its own. Sometimes however, the client has
to connect to <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> again in order to proceed with communication with the server.
For <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> this would then be a <i>connection</i> request, which can
go one of either 2 similar ways:  <i>relaying</i> and <i>firewalling</i>.

<ul type="circle">
  <li>In <i>relay</i> mode <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> passes data from the client to
  the server and back, playing role of a middleman. Data <i>relaying</i> occurs when, for instance,
  a Web-browser client wants to communicate with a service governed by <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt>.
  <li>In <i>firewall</i> mode <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> only sends out the information
  about where the client has to connect to in order to communicate with the server.
  This connection point and verifiable ticket are specified in <a href="#ref_ConnectionInfo"><tt>Connection-Info:</tt></a>
  tag in the reply header.<br>
  <u>Note</u>: <i>Firewalling</i> is actually pertaining only to stateful-capable clients and servers.
</ul>
<i>Firewall</i> mode is selected by presence of <tt>FIREWALL</tt> in
<tt>Accepted-Server-Types:</tt> tag set by the clients sitting behind a firewall,
and not being able to connect to an arbitrary port.

<p>
These are scenarios of data flow between the client and the server
depending on "stateness" of the client:
<ul>
  <li><b>Stateless</b> client
  <ul type="square">
  <li>Client is <u>not</u> using <u>firewall</u> mode:
  <ol type="A">
  <li> the client has to connect to the server by its own, using dispatching
       information obtained earlier, or
  <li> the client connects to <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> in <i>connection</i> request
       (e.g. the case of Web-browsers), and <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt>
       makes data relaying for the client to the server.
  </ol>
  <li>Client chooses to use <u>firewall</u> mode, then the only
  way to communicate with server is to connect to <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> (making
  <i>connection</i> request), and use <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> as a relay.
  <br>
  <u>Note</u>:
  Even if the server is standalone (but having <i>no</i> <a href="LBSMD.html#ref_Stateful"><tt>S=yes</tt></a>
  in configuration file of <tt>LBSMD</tt>), then <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> initiates a microsession
  to the server and wraps its output into HTTP/1.0-compliant reply.
  Data from both <tt>HTTP</tt> and <tt>NCBID</tt> servers are simply relayed one-to-one.
  </ul>

  <li><b>Stateful-capable</b> client
  <ul type="square">
  <li>Client is <u>not</u> using <u>firewall</u> mode then
      the client has to connect directly to the server, using dispatcher
      information obtained earlier (e.g. with the use of <tt>INFORMATION_ONLY</tt>
      in <tt>Dispatch-Mode:</tt> tag).
  <li>If <u>firewall</u> mode selected then the client has to expect <a href="#ref_ConnectionInfo"><tt>Connection-Info:</tt></a>
      to come back from <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> pointing where to connect to
      the server. If <tt>TRY_STATELESS</tt> comes out as a value of the former
      tag, then the client has to switch into stateless mode (e.g. by setting <tt>STATELESS_ONLY</tt> in
      <tt>Client-Mode:</tt> tag) in order for the request to succeed.<br>
      <u>Note</u>: <tt>TRY_STATELESS</tt> could be induced by many reasons, mainly that all servers for the service are stateless
      ones, or that firewall daemon is not available on the host, where the client's request was received.
  </ul>
</ul>
<u>Note</u>: Depicted scenarios show that no prior dispatching information is required for the stateless client
to have in order to make a <i>connection</i> request, as <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> can
always be used as a data relay (this way Web-browsers can access NCBI services).
But for stateful-capable client to establish a dedicated connection that
additional step of obtaining dispatching information must precede the actual <i>connection</i>.

<p>
In order to support requests from Web-browsers, which are unaware of HTTP
extensions comprising dispatching protocol, <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> considers incoming request,
which does not contain input dispatching tags, as a <i>connection</i>
request from a stateless-only client.

<p>
<tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> uses simple heuristics in analyzing HTTP header to determine whether the <i>connection</i>
request comes from a Web-browser, or from an application (a <a href="../../libs/conn.html#ref_ServiceConnector">service
connector</a>, for instance). In case of a Web-browser, the data path could be chosen more expensive but more robust,
including connection retries if required, while on the contrary with an application, the dispatcher could return
an error and the retry is delegated to the application.

<p>
<tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> always preserves original HTTP tags <tt>"User-Agent:"</tt> and <tt>"Client-Platform:</tt> when
doing both <i>relaying</i> and <i>firewalling</i>.

<a name="ref_NCBID"></a><h2>Service Launcher (<tt>NCBID.CGI</tt>)</h2>

There are servers of type <a href="LBSMD.html#ref_ServerType"><tt>NCBID</tt></a>, which
are really programs that read requests from <tt>stdin</tt> and write replies into
<tt>stdout</tt> without having sort of a common protocol. Thus, HTTP/1.0 was
chosen as a framed protocol wrapping both requests and replies, and <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt>
utility CGI program was created to pass the request from HTTP body to the
server and to put reply from the server into HTTP body and send back to the client.
Also, <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt> is to provide a dedicated connection between the
server and the client, if the client supports stateful way of communication.
Formely <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt> was implemented as a
separate CGI program, but recently it was integrated into and became a part of
<tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> (now <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt> is a symbolic link to <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt>).

<p>
<tt>NCBID.CGI</tt> determines the requested service from the query string the
same way as <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> does so, i.e. by looking into the
value of CGI parameter <tt>service</tt>. Executable file, which has to be run, is then determined by searching
configuration file (shared with <tt>LBSMD</tt>, default name is <tt>servrc.cfg</tt>):
the path to the executable along with optional command-line parameters is specified after the bar character
(<tt>|</tt>) in the line containing the <a href="LBSMD.html#ref_Service">service description</a>.

<p>
<tt>NCBID.CGI</tt> can work in either of&nbsp;2 connection modes, stateless and stateful,
which is determined from reading the following HTTP header tag:

<ul>
<tt><font color="#009900">Connection-Mode: <i>&lt;mode></i></font></tt>
<br>where <tt><i>&lt;mode></i></tt> is one of the following:
<ul type="square">
<li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">STATEFUL</font></tt></li>
<li><tt><font color="#CC33CC">STATELESS</font></tt></li>
</ul>
Default (when the tag is missing) is <tt>STATELESS</tt> to support calls from Web-browsers.
</ul>

<p>
When <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt> relays data to <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt> this tag is set in
accordance with current client mode.

<p>
<tt>STATELESS</tt> mode is almost identical to call to a conventional CGI program,
except that in HTTP header there could be tags pertaining to dispatching protocol,
and resulting from data relaying (if any) by <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt>.

<p>
In <tt>STATEFUL</tt> mode <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt> starts the program in a more tricky way,
which is closer to work in firewall mode for <tt>DISPD.CGI</tt>. Namely, <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt>
loads the  program with its <tt>stdin</tt> and <tt>stdout</tt> bound to a port, which is
made listening. That is the program becomes sort of an Internet daemon (only exception
that exactly one incoming connection is allowed). Then the client is sent back an HTTP
reply containing <a href="#ref_ConnectionInfo"><tt>Connection-Info:</tt></a> tag.
The client has to use port, host and ticket from that tag in order to connect to
the server by creating a dedicated TCP connection.<br>
<u>Note</u>: <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt> <i>never</i> generates <tt>TRY_STATELESS</tt> keyword.

<p>
For the sake of backward compatibility, <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt> creates the following
environment variables (in addition to CGI/1.0 environment variables created by the HTTP daemon
when calling <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt>) before starting the service executables: <tt>NI_CLIENT_IPADDR</tt> and
<tt>NI_CLIENT_PLATFORM</tt>. The former contains IP address of the remote host (could
be IP address of the firewall daemon if <tt>NCBID.CGI</tt> was started as a
result of <i>firewalling</i>). The latter environment variable contains client
platform extracted from the HTTP tag <tt>"Client-Platform:"</tt> if any provided
by the client.
