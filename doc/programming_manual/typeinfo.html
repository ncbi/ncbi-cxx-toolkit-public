<a name ="introduction"> <h3>Introduction</h3>
Information about data types is necessary in several contexts, including:
<ol>

 <li> When reading, writing, and processing serialized data, where information about a
 type's internal structure is needed;<p>

 <li> When reading from an arbitrary data file, where data members' 
 external aliases must be used to locate the corresponding class data members
 (e.g. <i>MyXxx</i> may be aliased as <i>my-xxx</i> in the file); <p>

 <li> When using a generalized <a href="iterators.html"><i> C++ type iterator</i></a> to traverse the data
 members of a structured object.  
</ol>

In some cases, the type information might be useful independent of any actual data instances. For
example, a C++ <a href="choice.html"><i>choice</i></a> object may have several choice
variants, but only one of these is actually selected (and therefore, instantiated) at any given
moment. Nevertheless, access to the complete set of choice variant <i>types</i> may be useful. In
other cases, an object may be cast as its more abstract parent type, and passed to a generic
function that must now access (and possibly modify) type-specific data members. In this context, it
is necessary to have access to both the object itself as well as to its type information. <p>

The NCBI C++ Toolkit uses two classes to support these requirements:
<ul><a name="ctypeinfo">
<li><strong><i>Type</i> information classes</strong> (base class <a
href="../docxx/CTypeInfo.html"><i>CTypeInfo</i> </a>) are intended for internal usage only,
and encode information about a type, devoid of any instances of that type. 

A <i>class</i> object's type information includes the class layout, inheritance relations, external
alias, and various other attributes such as size, which are independent of specific instances. Each
data member of a class also has its own type information. Thus, in addition to providing information
relevant to the member's occurence in the class (e.g. the member name and offset), the type
information for a <i>class</i> must also provide access to the type information for each of its
<i>members</i>.<p>

Limited type information is also available for types other than classes, such as
primitive data types, enumerations, containers, and pointers. For example, the type
information for a primitive type specifies that it is an <i>int, float,</i> or <i>char</i>, etc.,
and whether or not that element is signed. Enumerations are a special kind of primitive type,
whose type information specifies its enumeration values and named elements. Type information
for containers can specify both the type of container and the type of elements which it holds.<p>

<li><a href="#cobjinfo"> <I>Object</i> information classes</a> (base class <a
href="../docxx/CObjectTypeInfo.html"><i>CObjectTypeInfo</i></a>) include a pointer to the
type information as well as a pointer to the object <i>instance</i> itself, and provide a
safe interface to that object. In situations where type information is used independent of
any concrete object, the <i>object</i> information class simply serves as a wrapper to a <i>type</i>
information object. Where access to an object instance <i>is</i> required, the object pointer
provides direct access to the correctly type-cast instance, and the interface provides methods to
access and/or modify the object itself or  members of that object.
</ul>

The C++ Toolkit stores the type information outside any instances of that type, in a statically
created <i>CTypeInfo</i> object.  For <i>class</i> objects, this <i>CTypeInfo</i> object can be
accessed by all instances of the class via a static <a
href="http://ray.nlm.nih.gov:6224/intranet/ieb/CPP/lxr/http/ident?i=GetTypeInfo">
<i>GetTypeInfo()</i></a> class method. Similarly, for primitive types and other constructs that
have no way of associating methods with them <i>per se</i>, a static globally defined 
<i>GetTypeInfoXxx()</i> function is used to access a static <i>CTypeInfo</i> object.
(The <i>Xxx</i> suffix is used here to indicate that a globally unique name is generated for the function). <p>

All of the automatically generated classes and constructs defined in the C++ Toolkit's
<i>objects</i> directory already have static <i>GetTypeInfo()</i> functions implemented for them. In
order to make type information about <i>user-defined</i> classes and elements also accessible, you
will need to implement static <i>GetTypeInfo()</i> functions for these constructs. A number of
pre-processor macros are available to support this activity, and are described  in the
section on <a href="usrtypeinfo.html"> <i>User-defined Type Information</i></a>. 


<p>

Type information is often needed when the object itself has been passed anonymously, or as a pointer
to its parent class. In this case, it is not possible to invoke the <i>GetTypeInfo()</i> method
directly, as the object's exact type is unknown. Using a <i>&lt;static_cast&gt;</i> operator to
enable the member function is also unsafe, as it may open the door to incorrectly associating an
object's pointer with the wrong type information.  For these reasons, the <i>CTypeInfo</i> class is
intended for internal usage only, and it is the <a href="#cobjinfo"> <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i></a> classes
that provide a more safe and friendly user interface to type information.<p>


<a name="motivation"> <h3> Motivation </h3>

We use a simple example to help motivate the use of this <i>type</i> and <i>object</i> information
model. Let us suppose that we would like to have a generic function <i>LoadObject()</i>, which can
populate an object using data read from a flat file. For example, we might like to have:

<center><pre>bool LoadObject (Object& myObj, istream& is); </pre></center>

where <i>myObj</i> is an instance of some subclass of <i>Object</i>. Assuming that the text in the
file is of the form:
<pre>MemberName value
MemberName value
MemberName value
:
</pre>
we would like to find the corresponding data member in <i>myObj</i> for each <i>MemberName</i>, and set
that data member's value accordingly. Unfortunately, <i>myObj</i> cannot directly supply any useful
type information, as the member names we seek are for a specific subclass of <i>Object</i>. Now suppose
that we have an appropriate type information object available for <i>myObj</i>, and consider how
this might be used:
<a name = "example">
<font color="#000080"><pre>
bool LoadObject (TypeInfo& info, Object& myObj, istream& is)
{
    string myName, myValue;

    while (!is.eof()) {
        is >> myName >> myValue;
        void *member = FindMember(info, myObj, myName);
	assignValue(member, myValue);
    }
}</pre></font>

Here, we assume that our type information object, <i>info</i>, stores information about the memory
offset of each data member in <i>myObj</i>, and that such information can be retrieved using some
sort of identifying member name such as <i>myName</i>. This is not too difficult to imagine, and
indeed, this is exactly the type of information and facility provided by the C++ Toolkit's type
information classes. The <i>FindMember()</i> function just needs to return a <i>void</i> pointer to
the appropriate location in memory.  The <i>assignValue()</i> function presents a much greater
challenge however, as its two sole arguments are a <i>void</i> pointer and a <i>string</i>. This
would be fine if the data member was indeed a <i>void</i> pointer, and a <i>string</i> value
was acceptable. In general this is not the case, and stronger methods are clearly needed.<p>

In particular, for each data member encountered, we need to retrieve the type of that member as well
as its location in memory, so as to process <i>myValue</i> appropriately before assigning it. In
addition, we need safer mechanisms for making such "untyped" assignments. Ideally, we would like a
<i>FindMember()</i> function that returns a correctly cast pointer to that data member, along with
its associated type information. This is what the <i>object</i> information classes provide - a
pointer to the object instance as well as a pointer to its static <i>type</i> information. The
interface to the <i>object</i> information class also provides a number of methods such as
<i>GetClassMember(), GetTypeFamily(), SetPrimitiveValue()</i>, etc., to support the type of activity
described above.

<ul><li> <a href= "#objtype"> <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i></a>
    <ul><li> <a href= "#constobj"> <i>CConstObjectInfo</i></a>
        <ul><li> <a href= "#objinfo"> <i>CObjectInfo</i></a>
</ul></ul></ul>

<a name="objtype"><h4><a href= "../docxx/CObjectTypeInfo.html"> <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i></a></h4>
The base class for all <i>object</i> information classes is the <a href=
"../docxx/CObjectTypeInfo.html"> <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i></a> class. This base class is intended for
usage where there is <i>no</i> concrete object being referenced, and all that is required is access to the
type information. A <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> contains a pointer to a <i>CTypeInfo</i> object, and functions
as a wrapper class.<p>

The constructor for <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> takes a pointer to a <i>const CTypeInfo</i> object as its
single argument. This is precisely what is returned by all of the static <i>GetTypeInfo()</i>
functions. Thus, to create a <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> for the <i>CBioseq</i> class - without reference
to any particular instance of <i>CBioseq</i> - one might use:<p>

<center><i>  CObjectTypeInfo objInfo(CBioseq::GetTypeInfo())</i> </center><p>

One of the most important methods provided by the <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> class interface is
<i>GetTypeFamily()</i>, which returns an enumerated value indicating the type family for the object
of interest. Five type families are defined by the <i>ETypeFamily</i> enumeration:

<font color = "#008080"><pre>
        ETypeFamily GetTypeFamily(void) const;

	enum ETypeFamily {
	    eTypeFamilyPrimitive,
	    eTypeFamilyClass,
	    eTypeFamilyChoice,
	    eTypeFamilyContainer,
	    eTypeFamilyPointer
	};
</pre></font>


Different queries become appropriate depending on the <i>ETypeFamily</i> of the object. For example,
if the object is a container, one might need to determine the type of container (e.g. <i>list,
map</i> etc.),  and the type of element. Similarly, if an object is a primitive type (e.g. <i>int,
float, string, </i> etc.), an appropriate query becomes what the value type is, and in the case of
integer-valued types, whether or not it is </i>signed</i>. Finally, in the case of more complex 
objects such as class and choice objects, access to the type information for the individual data
members and choice variants is needed.  
The following  methods are included in the <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> interface for these purposes:

<ul>
<li><i>GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyPrimitive</i>:<ul>
<li><i> EPrimitiveValueType GetPrimitiveValueType(void) const;</i>
<li><i> bool IsPrimitiveValueSigned(void) const;</i></ul><p>
<a name="cmemit">
<li><i>GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyClass</i>:<ul>
<li><i> CMemberIterator BeginMembers(void) const;</i>
<li><i> CMemberIterator FindMember(const string& memberName) const;</i>
<li><i> CMemberIterator FindMemberByTag(int memberTag) const;</i></ul><p>
<a name="cvarit">
<li><i>GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyChoice</i>:<ul>
<li><i> CVariantIterator BeginVariants(void) const;</i>
<li><i> CVariantIterator FindVariant(const string& memberName) const;</i>
<li><i> CVariantIterator FindVariantByTag(int memberTag) const;</i></ul><p>

<li><i>GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyContainer</i>:<ul>
<li><i> EContainerType GetContainerType(void) const;</i>
<li><i> CObjectTypeInfo GetElementType(void) const;</i></ul><p>

<li> <i>GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyPointer</i>:<ul>
<li><i> CObjectTypeInfo GetPointedType(void) const;</i>
</ul></ul>

<p>
The two additional enumerations referred to here, <a href=
"http://ray.nlm.nih.gov:6224/intranet/ieb/CPP/lxr/http/ident?i=EContainerType"><i>EContainerType</i></a> 
and <a href = 
"http://ray.nlm.nih.gov:6224/intranet/ieb/CPP/lxr/http/ident?i=EPrimitiveValueType"><i>EPrimitiveValueType</i></a>,
are defined, along with <i>ETypeFamily</i>, in <i>include/serial/serialdef.hpp</i>.<p>

Different iterator classes are used for iterating over class data members versus
choice variant types. Thus, if the object of interest is a C++ <i>class</i> object, access
to the type information for its members can be gained using a
<i>CObjectTypeInfo::CMemberIterator</i>. The <i>BeginMembers()</i> method returns 
a <i>CMemberIterator</i> pointing to the first data member in the class; the 
<i>FindMember*()</i> methods return a <i>CMemberIterator</i> pointing to a data member
whose name or tag matches the input argument. The <i>CMemberIterator</i> class is a 
bidirectional iterator whose operators are defined as follows: 

<ul>
<li> the <i>++</i> and <i>--</i> operators increment/decrement the iterator, respectively
<li> the <i>()</i> operator tests that the iterator has not exceeded the legitimate range
<li> the <i>*</i> dereferencing operator returns a <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> object for the current data member
</ul>

Similarly, the <i>BeginVariants()</i> and <i>FindVariant()</i> methods allow 
iteration over the choice variant data types for a choice class, and the dereferencing  
operation yields a <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> object for the current choice variant.

<a name= "constobj"> 
<h4><a href="../docxx/CConstObjectInfo.html"><i>CConstObjectInfo</i></a></h4>
The <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> class is derived from <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i>, and is intended for usage
with <i>const</i> instances of the object of interest. In addition to all of the methods inherited from
the parent class (with respect to pure type information), the interface to this class also provides
access to runtime <i>instance</i> information. Because the object is assumed <i>const</i> however, the
interface does not permit any modifications to the object in its methods. The constructor for
<i>CConstObjectInfo</i> takes two arguments:<p>

<center><i>    CConstObjectInfo(const void* instancePtr, const CTypeInfo* typeinfoPtr);</i></center><p>

Alternatively, the constructor can be invoked with a single STL <i>pair</i> containing these
two objects, i.e.:<p>

<center><i>    CConstObjectInfo(pair&lt;const void*, const CTypeInfo*>);</i></center>
<p>

Each <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> contains a pointer to the object's type information as well as
a pointer to an instance of the object. The existence or validity of this instance
can be checked using any of the following <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> methods and operators:
<ul>
<li><i> bool Valid(void) const;</i>
<li><i> operator bool(void) const;</i>
<li><i> bool operator!(void) const;</i>
</ul>
The instance pointed to can be accessed via <i>CConstObjectInfo::GetObjectPtr()</i>, and the 
pointer can be reset to a null pointer using <i>CConstObjectInfo::ResetObjectPtr()</i>. The 
value type returned by <i>GetObjectPtr</i> is a <i>void</i> pointer however, and is therefore
of limited utility. A more useful method is the <i>GetPair()</i> function, which returns
an STL <i>pair</i>:

<pre>
		pair&lt;const void*, const CTypeInfo*> GetPair(void) const;
</pre>

For <i>primitive</i> type objects, the <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> interface provides access to the currently
assigned value using <i>GetPrimitiveValueXxx()</i>. Here, <i>Xxx</i> may be <i>Bool, Char, Long,
ULong, Double, String, ValueString,</i> or <i>OctetString</i>. In general, to get a primitve value, one first 
applies a <i>switch</i> statement to the value returned by <i>GetPrimitiveValueType()</i>, and then
calls the appropriate <i>GetPrimitiveValueXxx()</i> method depending on the branch followed, e.g.:

<font color="#000080"><pre>

        switch (obj.GetPrimitiveValueType()) {

	case ePrimitiveValueBool:
            obj.GetPrimitiveValueBool();
	    break;

        case ePrimitiveValueInteger:
            if (obj.IsPrimitiveValueSigned()) 
	       obj.GetPrimitiveValueLong();
	    else
               obj.GetPrimitiveValueULong();
	    break;

	//... etc.
        }
</pre></font>

Data member and choice variant iterator methods are also defined in the <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> class, with 
a similar interface to that found in the <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> class. In this case however, the dereferencing
operators return a <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> object - <i>not</i> a <i>CObjectTypeInfo()</i> object - for
the current member or choice variant. The names of these member functions are:

<ul><li> For C++ <i>class</i> objects:
    <ul><li><i> CMemberIterator BeginMembers(void) const;</i>
	<li><i> CMemberIterator FindClassMember(const string& memberName) const;</i>
	<li><i> CMemberIterator FindClassMemberByTag(int memberTag) const;</i></ul>

    <li> For C++ <i>choice</i> objects:
    <ul><li><i> TMemberIndex GetCurrentChoiceVariantIndex(void) const;</i>
        <li><i> CChoiceVariant GetCurrentChoiceVariant(void) const;</i></ul>
</ul>
Similarly, for <i>pointer</i> type objects, the type returned by the method <i>GetPointedObject()</i>
is also a <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> for the object - not a <i>CObjectTypeInfo</i> object.<p>

The <i>CConstObjectInfo</i> class also defines an <i>element</i> iterator for container 
type objects. Like other bidirectional iterators, the <i>CElementIterator</i> interface
includes increment, decrement, testing, and dereferencing operators. In this case, the
dereferencing operator (*) returns an STL <i>pair&lt;const void*, const CTypeInfo*></i> that
references the current element.

<p>
<a name= "objinfo"> 
<h4><a href="../docxx/CObjectInfo.html"><i>CObjectInfo</i></a></h4>
The <i>CObjectInfo</i> class is in turn derived from <i>CConstObjectInfo</i>, and is intended for usage
with <i>mutable</i> instances of the object of interest. In addition to all of the methods inherited from
the parent class, the interface to this class also provides methods that allow modification of the
object itself or its data members.<p>

For <i>primitive</i> type objects, a set of <i>SetPrimitiveValueXxx()</i> methods are available,
complimentary to the <i>GetPrimitiveValueXxx()</i> methods described above.  Methods that return
member and choice variant iterator objects are again reimplemented, and the de-referencing operators
now return a <i>CObjectInfo</i> object for that data member or variant. As the <i>CObjectInfo</i>
now points to a <i>mutable</i> object, these iterators can be used to set values for the data member
or variant. Similarly, the dereferencing operator (*) for a <i>CObjectInfo</i>'s
<i>CElementIterator</i> returns an STL <i>pair&lt;void*, const CTypeInfo*></i>, where the element
pointed to by the <i>void</i> pointer is mutable.

<a name = "usage"> <h3>Usage of object type information </h3>
We can now reconsider how the <a href="#example"> <i>LoadObject()</i></a> function might be
implemented using the <i>CObjectInfo</i> class:

<font color="#000080"><pre>
bool LoadObject (CObjectInfo& info, CNcbiIStream& is)
{
     string alias, myValue;

     while (!is.eof()) {

         is >> alias >> myValue;

         CObjectInfo dataMember(*info.FindClassMember(alias));

         if (!dataMember) {
            ERR_POST(ERROR, "Couldn't find member named:" << alias);
         }

	 SetValue (dataMember, myValue);
     }	 
}
</pre></font>
The <i>CObjectInfo</i> object (<i>info</i>) contains pointers to the <i>CObject</i> itself as well as to its 
associated <i>CTypeInfo</i> object. For each member alias read from the file, we apply <i>FindClassMember(alias)</i>,
and dereference the returned iterator to retrieve a <i>CObjectInfo</i> object for that member. We then use the
operator <i>()</i> to verify that the member was located, and if so, use the member's <i>CObjectInfo</i> 
to set a value in the function <i>SetValue()</i>: 

<font color="#000080"><pre>
void SetValue(const CObjectInfo& obj, const string value)
{
    if (obj.GetTypeFamily() == eTypeFamilyPrimitive) {

        switch (obj.GetPrimitiveValueType()) {

	case ePrimitiveValueBool:
            obj.SetPrimitiveValueBool (atoi (value.c_str()));
	    break;

        case ePrimitiveValueChar:
            obj.SetPrimitiveValueChar (value.c_str()[0]);
	    break;

	//... etc
	}

    else {
        ERR_POST(ERROR, "Attempt to assign non-primitive from string:" << value);
}
</pre></font>
In this example, <i>SetValue()</i> can only assign primitive types. More generally however, 
the <i>CObjectInfo</i> class allows the assignment of more complex types that are simply 
not implemented here. Note also that the arguments to <i>SetValue()</i> are <i>const</i>, even
though the function <i>does</i> modify the value of the data instance pointed to. In particular, the
type <i>const CObjectInfo</i> should not be confused with the type <i>CConstObjectInfo</i>. The
former specifies that object information construct is non-mutable, although the instance it 
points to can be modified. The latter specifies that the instance itself is non-mutable. <p>

In addition to user-specific applications of the type demonstrated in this example, the generic
implementations of the <a href="iterators.html"> <i>C++ type iterators</i></a> and the <a
href="objstream.html"><i>CObject[IO]Stream </i></a> class methods provide excellent examples of how
runtime object type information can be deployed. <p>

As a final example of how type information might be used, we consider an application whose simple task 
is to translate a data file on an input stream to a different format on an output stream. One important 
use of the object classes defined in <i>include/objects</i> is the hooks and parsing mechanisms they make 
available to applications utilizing <a href="objstream.html"><i>CObject[IO]Stream</i>s</a>. 
The stream objects specialize in different formats (such as XML or ASN.1), and must work in concert
with these type-specific object classes to interpret or generate serialized data.  In some cases
however, the dynamic memory allocation required for large objects may be substantial, and it is
preferable to avoid actually instantiating a concrete object.<p>

Instead, it is possible to use the <a href="../docxx/CObjectStreamCopier.html">
<i>CObjectStreamCopier</i></a> class, described in <a href="objstream.html"> 
<i>CObject[IO]Streams</i></a>.  Briefly, this class holds two <i>CObject[IO]Stream</i> data members
pointing to the input and output streams, and a set of <i>Copy</i> methods which take a
<i>CTypeInfo</i> argument. Using this class, it is easy to translate files between 
different formats; for example:
<pre>
    auto_ptr<CObjectIStream>  in(CObjectIStream::Open("mydata.xml", eSerial_Xml));
    auto_ptr<CObjectOStream> out(CObjectOStream::Open("mydata.asn", eSerial_AsnBinary));
    CObjectStreamCopier copier(*in, *out);
    copier.Copy (CBioseq_set::GetTypeInfo());
</pre>
copies a <i>CBioseq_set</i> encoded in XML to a new file, reformatted in ASN.1 binary
format.<p>
