 <h3> <i>STL auto_ptrs</i> </h3> </a>
C programmers are well-acquainted with the advantages and pitfalls of using pointers. As is often 
the case, the good news is also the bad news: 
<ul>
<li> memory can be dynamically allocated as needed, but may not be deallocated as needed, due
	  to unanticipated execution paths;
<li> void pointers allow heterogeneous function arguments of different types, but type
	  information may not be there when you need it.
</ul>
C++ adds some additional considerations to pointer management: STL containers cannot hold <i>
reference</i> objects, so you are left with the choice of using either pointers or <i>copies</i>
of objects. Neither choice is attractive, as pointers can cause memory leaks and the copy 
constructor may be expensive. </p>

The idea behind a C++ <i>smart pointer</i> is to create a wrapper class capable of holding a
pointer.  The wrapper class's constructors and destructors can then handle memory management as
the object goes in and out of scope. The problem with this solution is that it does not handle
multiple pointers to the same resource properly, and it raises the issue of ownership. This is
essentially what the 
<a href="../docxx/auto_ptr.html">
<i>auto_ptr</i></a> offers, but this strategy is only safe to use when the
resource maps to a single pointer variable.<p>

For example, the following code has two very serious problems:
<pre>
    int* ip = new int(5);
    {
        auto_ptr&lt;int&gt; a1 = ip;
        auto_ptr&lt;int&gt; a2 = ip;
    }
    *ip = 10/(*ip);
</pre>

The first problem occurs inside the block where the two <i>auto_ptrs</i> are defined.
Both are referencing the same variable pointed to by yet another <i>C</i> pointer, and
each considers itself to be the owner of that reference. Thus, when the block is exited,
the <i>delete[]</i> operation is executed twice for the same pointer. <p>

Even if this first problem did not occur - for example if only one <i>auto_ptr</i> had been
defined - the second problem occurs when we try to dereference <i>ip</i>. The
<i>delete</i> operation occurring as the block exits has now reset <i>*ip</i> to <i>0</i>, 
so an attempt to divide by zero occurs. 

<a name="cref"> <a href="../docxx/CRef.html">
<h3>The <i>CRef</i> Class </h3></a>

These issues are addressed in the NCBI C++ Toolkit by using <i>reference-counted</i> smart
pointers: a resource cannot be deallocated until <i>all</i> references to it have ceased to
exist. The implementation of a smart pointer in the NCBI C++ Toolkit is actually divided
between two classes:
<a href="../docxx/CRef.html"> <i>CRef</i></a> and 
<a href="../docxx/CObject.html">
<i>CObject</i></a>. <p>

The <i>CRef</i> class essentially provides a pointer interface to a <i>CObject</i>, while the
<i>CObject</i> actually stores the data and maintains the reference count to it.  The
constructor used to create a new <i>CRef</i> pointing to a particular <i>CObject</i>
automatically increments the object's reference count. Similarly, the <i>CRef</i> destructor
automatically decrements the reference count. In both cases however, the modification of the
reference count is implemented by a member function of the <i>CObject</i>.  The <i>CRef</i>
class itself does not have direct access to the reference count and contains only a single data
member -- its pointer to a <i>CObject</i>. In addition to the <i>CRef</i> class's constructors and
destructors, its interface to the <i>CObject</i> pointer includes access/mutate functions such as:

<dl>
 <dt><i>bool Empty() </i>
 <dt><i>bool NotEmpty() </i>
 <dt><i>CObject* GetPointer()</i>
 <dt><i>CObject& GetObject()</i>
 <dt><i>CObject* Release()</i>
 <dt><i>void Reset(CObject* newPtr)</i>
 <dt><i>void Reset(void)</i>
 <dt><i>operator bool()</i>
 <dt><i>bool operator!()</i>
 <dt><i>CRefBase& operator=(const CRefBase& ref)</i>
</dl>
Both the <i>Release()</i> and <i>Reset()</i> functions set the <i>CRef</i> object's <i>m_ptr</i> to
0, thus effectively removing the reference to its <i>CObject</i>. There are important distinctions 
between these two functions however. The <i>Release()</i> method removes the reference without 
destroying the object, while the <i>Reset()</i> method may lead to the destruction of the 
object if there are no other references to it. 
<p>
If the <i>CObject</i>'s internal reference count is 1 at the time <i>Release()</i> is invoked,
that reference count will be decremented to 0, and a pointer to the <i>CObject</i> is
returned. The <i>Release()</i> method can throw two types of exceptions: (1) a <i>null
pointer</i> exception if <i>m_ptr</i> is already <i>0</i>, and (2) an <i>Illegal
CObject::ReleaseReference()</i> exception if there are currently other references to that
object. An object must be free of all references (but this one) before it can be
"released". In contrast, the <i>Reset(void)</i> function simply resets the <i>CRef</i>'s
<i>m_ptr</i> to 0, decrements the <i>CObject</i>'s reference count, and, if the <i>CObject</i>
has no other references and was dynamically allocated, deletes the <i>CObject</i>.

<p>
Each member function of the <i>CRef</i> class also has a <i>const</i> implementation that is
invoked when the pointer is to a <i>const</i> object. In addition, there is also a
<a href="../docxx/CConstRef.html">
<i>CConstRef</i></a> class that parallels the <i>CRef</i> class.

Both <i>CRef</i> and <i>CConstRef</i> are implemented as template classes, where the template
argument specifies the type of object which will be pointed to. For example, in the section on <a
href="traverse.html#accessMember"> Traversing an ASN.1 Data Structure</a> we examined the structure of the
<i>CBiostruc</i> class and found the following type definition

<pre>
    typedef list< CRef< ::CBiostruc_id > > TId;
</pre>

As described there, this <i>typedef</i> defines <i>TId</i> to be a list of pointers to
<a href="../docxx/CBiostruc_id.html">
<i>CBiostruc_id</i></a> objects. And as you might expect, <i>CBiostruc_id</i> is a 
specialized subclass of  <i>CObject</i>. 
<p>

<a name="cobject"> <a href="../docxx/CObject.html">
 <h3> The CObject Class </h3></a>
The <i>CObject</i> class serves as a base class for all objects requiring a reference
count. There is little overhead entailed by deriving a new class from this base
class, and most objects in the NCBI C++ Toolkit are derived from the <i>CObject</i> class.
For example, 
<a href="../docxx/CNCBINode.html">
<i>CNCBINode</i></a> is a direct descendant of <i>CObject</i>, and all of the other
<i>HTML</i> classes descend either directly or indirectly from <i>CNCBINode</i>. Similarly, all 
of the ASN.1 classes defined in the 
<a href="http://ray.nlm.nih.gov:6224/intranet/ieb/CPP/lxr/http/source/include/objects">
<i>include/objects</i></a> directory, as well as many of the classes defined in the
<a href="http://ray.nlm.nih.gov:6224/intranet/ieb/CPP/lxr/http/source/include/serial">
<i>include/serial</i></a> directory are derived either directly or indirectly from the
<i>CObject</i> class.<p>

The <i>CObject</i> class contains a single private data member, the reference counter, and a
set of member functions which provide an interface to the reference counter. As such, it is
truly a base class which has no stand-alone utility, as it does not even provide allocation
for data values. It is the <i>descendant</i> classes, which inherit all the functionality of
the <i>CObject</i> class, that provide the necessary richness in representation and 
allocation required for the widely diverse set of objects implemented in the NCBI
C++ Toolkit. Nevertheless, it is often necessary to use smart pointers on simple data types,
such as <i>int</i>, <i>string</i> etc. The <i>CObjectFor</i> class, described below, was
designed for this purpose.

<p>
<a name="exmpl"> <h3>
The 
<a href="../docxx/CObjectFor.html">
<i>CObjectFor</i> class</a>: Using smart pointers for standard types</h3>

The <i>CObjectFor</i> class is derived directly from <i>CObject</i>, and is implemented as a
template class whose argument specifies the standard type that will be pointed to. In addition to
the reference counter inherited from its parent class, <i>CObjectFor</i> has a private 
data member of the parameterized type, and a member function <i>GetData()</i> to access it.<p>

An example program, <a href="smart_cpp.html"> <i>smart.cpp</i></a>, uses the 
<a href="../docxx/CRef.html">
<i>CRef</i></a> and <a href="../docxx/CObjectFor.html">
<i>CObjectFor</i></a> classes, and demonstrates the differences in memory management that arise
using <i>auto_ptr</i> and <i>CRef</i>.

Using an <i>auto_ptr</i> to reference an <i>int</i>, the
program tests whether or not the reference is still accessible after an auxilliary <i>auto_ptr</i>
which goes out of scope has also been used to reference it. The same sequence is then tested
using <i>CRef</i> objects instead. <p>

In the first case, the original <i>auto_ptr,
orig_ap,</i> becomes NULL at the moment when ownership is transferred to
<i>copy_ap</i> by the copy constructor.  Using <i>CRef</i> objects however, the reference 
contained in the original <i>CRef</i> remains accessible (via <i>orig</i>) in all blocks where <i>orig</i> 
is defined. Moreover, the reference itself, i.e. the object pointed to, continues to exist
until <i>all</i> references to it have been removed.

	  <p>
<a name="usage"> <h3>When to use <i>CRef</i>s and <i>auto_ptr</i>s</h3>

There is some overhead in using <i>CRef</i> and <i>auto_ptr</i>, and these objects should only be used
where needed.  Memory leaks are generally caused as a result of unexpected execution paths. For
example:

<pre>
{
    int *num = new int(5);
    ComplexFunction (num);
    delete num;   
    ...
}
</pre>
If <i>ComplexFunction()</i> executes normally, control returns to the block where it was
invoked, and memory is freed by the <i>delete</i> statement. Unforeseen events however, may
trigger exceptions, causing control to pass elsewhere. In these cases, the <i>delete</i>
statement may never be reached. The use of a <i>CRef</i> or an <i>auto_ptr</i> is appropriate
for these situations, as they both guarantee that the object will be destroyed when the
reference goes out of scope. <p>

One situation where they may not be required is when a pointer is embedded inside another
object. If that object's destructor also handles the deallocation of its embedded objects, then
it is sufficient to use a <i>CRef</i> on the containing object only.
