    <h1>NCBI C++ Library Dependency Graph</h1>
    This graph was obtained by building the full toolkit and then
    running the following commands: <pre>
.../bin/depgraph .../lib/lib* > depgraph.out
.../bin/depgraph2dot -simplify -in depgraph.out -out depgraph.dot
dot -Tgif -o depgraph.gif.tmp depgraph.dot
giftopnm depgraph.gif.tmp | pnmtoppm '#FFFFFF' | ppmtogif -transparent '#FFFFFF' > depgraph.gif
</pre>
where <tt>dot</tt> comes from AT&T's
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">Graphviz</a>
package.  If you are at NCBI, you can find the source to
<tt>depgraph</tt> and <tt>depgraph2dot</tt>
<a href="http://intranet.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/internal/util/depgraph/">here.</a>
