Version 1.27.0 (2025-08-14):
* Advance to GCC 13.2 and to version 29.0 of the stable C++ Toolkit
  components, notably switching the default "ftds" driver to version
  1.4; "ftds100" remains available as an alternative.
* Correctly recognize stored procedure output parameters under Sybase and
  temporary stored procedure parameters under Microsoft SQL Server.
* Implement PEP 249's optional error handling extension (albeit passing
  exceptions themselves as "exception values" for simplicity).
* Drop Python 3.9, no longer supported.

Version 1.26.2 (2025-02-06):
* Add a Python 3.13 build alongside those for 3.9 and 3.11.

Version 1.26.1 (2024-12-06):
* Eliminate spurious output accidentally introduced when adding support
  for configuration files in the previous version.

Version 1.26.0 (2024-08-23):
* Advance to version 28.0 of the stable C++ Toolkit components.
* Honor configuration files: python_ncbi_dbapi.ini and/or .ncbirc.
* Allow connect to take keyword arguments (using PEP 249 names where
  applicable) and accept support_standard_interface alongside extra
  regardless, in that order when passing both positionally.

Version 1.25.4 (2023-10-27):
* Implement a set_logger extension.  (This module historically always used
  the root logger directly, and still does by default.)

Version 1.25.3 (2023-10-03):
* Avoid prematurely freeing logging-related Python objects.

Version 1.25.2 (2023-09-21):
* Play better with code using logging.basicConfig, which would otherwise
  take effect only with force = True.  There are still some scenarios
  in which this module will implicitly establish a stock configuration,
  but it now issues a warning immediately beforehand.
* Drop the build for Python 3.8 (no longer supported), leaving just
  3.9 and 3.11.

Version 1.25.1 (2023-01-26):
* Anticipate possible output from statements with OUTPUT clauses
  (checked only for INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, and MERGE).
* Give cursor.execute and cursor.executemany an optional keyword-only
  output_expected argument in case the above change is insufficient.
  (NB: The module always anticipates output from SELECT statements and
  statements whose verbs it doesn't specifically recognize.)

Version 1.25.0 (2022-12-06):
* Advance to version 27.0 of the stable C++ Toolkit components.
* Support (and build for) Python 3.11 in addition to 3.8 and 3.9.

Version 1.24.0 (2022-07-07):
* Advance to version 26.0 of the stable C++ Toolkit components,
  thereby dropping the long-deprecated ftds95 driver.
* Avoid OverflowError from large integer parameters.

Version 1.23.2 (2021-12-15):
* Support datetimeoffset more fully, albeit with results always coming
  back as corresponding "aware" UTC.
* Compensate for some Sybase ctlib quirks in UTF-8 locales.
* Handle SYBUINTN, as notably returned from Sybase IQ COUNT(...).
* Drop the build for Python 3.7 (no longer supported), leaving just
  3.8 and 3.9.
* Belatedly note connect's optional argument in its docstring.

Version 1.23.1 (2021-06-22):
* Fix crashes in release_global_lock mode when (automatically) logging.

Version 1.23.0 (2021-03-04):
* Advance to version 25.0 of the stable C++ Toolkit components.
* Update Python version coverage, substituting 3.9 for 3.6 (and keeping
  3.7 and 3.8).
* Correct reported parameter style to quoted, because our named style
  uses a non-standard prefix from the specification's perspective.
* Clean up deprecation warnings.

Version 1.22.0 (2021-01-05):
* Advance to version 24.0 of the stable C++ Toolkit components.
* Correct error reporting, particularly in cases of internal exception
  conversion (as when passing non-string arguments to connect).

Version 1.21.0 (2020-02-25):
* Advance to version 23.0 of the stable C++ Toolkit components, with
  FreeTDS 1.0 ("ftds100") now the default "ftds" and 0.95 ("ftds95")
  still available by explicit request (but 0.64 ["ftds64"] gone).
* Update Python version coverage, substituting 3.8 for 2.7 (and
  keeping 3.6 and 3.7).

Version 1.20.1 (2019-07-12):
* Clean up a stray dependency on libconnect.so.

Version 1.20.0 (2019-07-11):
* Advance to version 22.0 of the stable C++ Toolkit components and GCC 7.3,
  with FreeTDS 1.0 (ftds100) available by explicit request.
* Modernize Python version coverage, substituting 3.6 and 3.7 for 3.4
  (and keeping 2.7 for now).
* Fix AttributeError reporting under Python 3.

Version 1.19.4 (2018-02-05):
* Work around a Python limitation that could lead to crashes at exit.

Version 1.19.3 (2017-11-20):
* Properly distinguish text and binary values for the sake of Python 3
  users and Python 2 users who've explicitly opted into Unicode.

Version 1.19.2 (2017-09-06):

* Avoid crashing at exit under Python 3.

Version 1.19.0 (2017-08-31):

  compatibility (linked statically, as before).
* Log via the standard Python logging module.

* Advance to version 18.0 of the stable C++ Toolkit components, with
  ftds95 as default ftds and support for contacting dispd over HTTPS.

  GCC 4.8.1.

Version 1.15.2 (2015-09-21):
* Produce wheels for decentralized installation, not tarballs for
  centralized installation.

* Rework exception translation to follow PEP 249 more closely.

Version 1.15.0 (2012-11-09):

  DBAPI calls.
* Advance to version 11.0 of the stable C++ Toolkit components.
