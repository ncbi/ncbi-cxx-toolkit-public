# Each line describes a single configuration
# The format is as follows:
# <HardwareIdentifier> : <ReleaseSuffix> : <CompilerConfigurationScriptWithKeys>
# Configuration script is relative to c++/compilers/unix/ .
# Release configurator assumes that this script will eventually call standard configure script and pass all options
# to it. So some standard options may be added by release configurator, such as --build-root-sfx, --with-projects,
# --with-distcc, --with-action etc.
