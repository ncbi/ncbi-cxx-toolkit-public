# Purpose: This file holds all the supported configurations of a package
#          It is used by release configurator.

APP: test_ccpp_read

# The -t key prevents inclusion of the tree builder into the release
# SVN_TAG_RELEASE_ADD_FLAGS: -t

# Each line describes a single configuration
# The format is as follows:
# <HardwareIdentifier> : <ReleaseSuffix> : <CompilerConfigurationScriptWithKeys>
# Configuration script is relative to c++/compilers/unix/ .
# Release configurator assumes that this script will eventually call standard configure script and pass all options
# to it. So some standard options may be added by release configurator, such as --build-root-sfx, --with-projects,
# --with-distcc, --with-action etc.
