/** Setup a TLS (Transport Layer Security) provider library to support SSL
 *  in ncbi_socket.h[pp].
 *
 * Currently we support mbedTLS and GNUTLS as the providers.  This call selects
 * a library, which is either the default or requested via the registry (aka
 * .ini file), or through the process environment (takes precedence over the
 * registry):
 *
 * [CONN]
 * USESSL={1,0,MBEDTLS,GNUTLS}
 *
 * CONN_USESSL={1,0,MBEDTLS,GNUTLS}
 *
 * "None", "No", "Off", and "False", all case-insensitively, are also accepted
 * for "0";  and "Yes", "On", and "True" -- for "1".
 *
 * If no provider is present in the build, "0" is assumed.  With "0", SSL
 * will not be availbale for SOCK sockets, and any secure session will fail.
 *
 * A missing setting or "1" both select the default provider as currently
 * configured within the toolkit.  
 *
 * @note GNUTLS is only available as an external 3rd party library, and must
 * be so configured (--with-gnutls) at the configuration stage of the build.
 * mbedTLS can also be used as an external installation, but the toolkit has
 * an embedded private copy of the library, which can be used transparently
 * without any additional dependencies.  That embedded copy will be used by
 * default, if no other provider is explicitly pre-set, selected, or disabled.

 * provider library (using an empty setting disables the logging).  Levels are
 * provider-specific, but generally the higher the level the more verbose is
 * the output, and usually level 0 is used to stop the log output altogether.
 * Note that these are looked up as "CONN_TLS_LOGLEVEL" in the environment or
 * "[CONN]TLS_LOGLEVEL" in the registry.

 * would be "MBEDTLS_LOGLEVEL" and would have priority over the generic one.

 * Note that GNUTLS has also its own environment setting "GNUTLS_DEBUG_LEVEL",
 * which will be considered if none of the TLS_LOGLEVEL settings are found.

/** Build NCBI_CRED from memory buffers containing an X.509 certificate and a
 *  private key, respectively, in either PEM or DER format (independently of
 *  each other).
 *
 *  The returned credentials handle must not be deleted while it's in use.
 *
 *  If a size is passed as 0, the corresponding pointer argument is assumed to
 *  be a '\0'-terminated string, and the size gets computed internally as
 *  strlen(ptr) + 1, to cover the trailing '\0' byte, see below.
 *
 *  To figure out the format of cert / key, the passed buffer gets analyzed to
 *  see whether the last byte is '\0' as well as whether the therefore properly
 *  terminated C-string happens to contain a "-----BEGIN " substring:  if both
 *  conditions are met, then the buffer is considered in PEM format;  or DER,
 *  otherwise.
 *
 * @note that the size value ("certsz" / "pkeysz"), when expliciltly specified,
 * MUST account for the terminating '\0' byte for the PEM formatted buffers.
 * It MUST always be specified exact for the DER formatted buffers.
 *
 * @warning Calling free() on the returned handle will cause memory leaks;  so
 * always use NcbiDeleteTlsCertCredentials() when the handle is no longer
 * needed.
