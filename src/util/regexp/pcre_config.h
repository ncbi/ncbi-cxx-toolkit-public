/* PCRE is written in Standard C, but there are a few non-standard things it
   can cope with, allowing it to run on SunOS4 and other "close to standard" 
   systems.

   You should normally change the definitions of HAVE_STRERROR and 
   HAVE_MEMMOVE to 1. If your system has bcopy() and not memmove(), change 
   the definition of HAVE_BCOPY instead of HAVE_MEMMOVE. If your system 
   has neither bcopy() nor memmove(), leave them both as 0; an emulation 
   function will be used. */

/* The following two definitions are mainly for the benefit of SunOS4, which
   doesn't have the strerror() or memmove() functions that should be present in
   all Standard C libraries. The macros HAVE_STRERROR and HAVE_MEMMOVE should
   normally be defined with the value 1 for other systems, but unfortunately we
   can't make this the default because "configure" files generated by autoconf
   will only change 0 to 1; they won't change 1 to 0 if the functions are not
   found. */
