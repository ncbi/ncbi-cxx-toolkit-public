# a single(sic!) library [LIB] made of object files [SRC] and [OBJ]

#
# a single shared(DLL) library [LIB] made of object files [SRC] and [OBJ]
# where [SRC].o will be automagically compiled from [SRC].cpp or
# [SRC].c, and [OBJ].o must be already compiled by this time.
# The following libs will be used to resolve external references:
#   [DLL_LIB] or [DLL_DLIB] -- libs located in the NCBI C++ "lib/" dir;
#   [LIBS]                  -- 3rd-party libs
#
# The library will be linked against DLL_DLIB in --with-dll configurations
# (and --with-gbench configurations) and DLL_LIB otherwise.

## Example of usage:
#
# srcdir = @srcdir@
# include @builddir@/Makefile.mk
#
# LIB = p1
# SRC = p1_src1 p1_src2
# OBJ = p1_myobj
#
# DLL_LIB  = xncbi
# LIBS = $(NETWORK_LIBS)
# .....
# CXXFLAGS = -g $(ORIG_CXXFLAGS) -D_DEBUG -DXYZ_P1_PROJECT
# .....
# include @builddir@/Makefile.both
