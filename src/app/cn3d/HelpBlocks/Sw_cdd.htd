<p align="left">The first item in this menu - <a href="#overview">CDD Overview</a>
- is presented when a CDD is downloaded from the server, and presents a
description of the CDD and buttons to activate the annotation and reference
panels. The rest of this menu is for advanced users and is only available when you have loaded a CDD alignment (of a particular
  data type) and have turned off the <b>CDD Read-Only</b> option in the<b> </b>
<a href="SW_File.htm#preferences">Preferences</a> panel.</p>

<h3><a name="overview"></a>CDD overview</h3>
<p>This is an informative panel that presents information about a CDD when
downloaded from the CDD server. It shows the name and description of the domain,
and if annotations and literature references are available, the buttons at the
bottom will open the <a href="#annotate">Edit Annotations</a> or
<a href="#references">Edit References</a> panels. If the <b>CDD Read-Only</b>
option in the <a href="SW_File.htm#preferences">Preferences</a> is
checked, then both annotations and references information will be read-only,
meaning you can view but not change the information.</p>
<h3><a name="name"></a>Edit name</h3>
Edit the short name of the CDD.
<h3><a name="description"></a>Edit description</h3>
Edit the CDD description. This text is actually stored as a single long string,
so line breaks are not preserved.
<h3><a name="notes"></a>Edit notes</h3>
Edit the CDD notes. This is free text in multiple lines, so line breaks (where
a line is not auto-wrapped) are preserved.
<h3><a name="references"></a>Edit PubMed references</h3>
This panel allows you to add PubMed ID links to the literature. Click <b>Add</b>
to add a new reference; the available references will appear in the list above.
Select any reference and click <b>Launch</b> to start up a web browser to get
more information on the article. Click <b>Edit</b> to change the reference number,
or <b>Delete</b> to remove it. <b>Move up</b> and <b>Move down</b> can be used to reorder the list.
<h3><a name="books"></a>Edit book references</h3>
Similar to the <i>PubMed references</i> panel as described above, this lets you maintain a list of
NCBI book references. These are in a format specific to NCBI's book viewer, in the form of 
<i>name<b>.</b>type<b>#</b>address<b>.</b>sub-address</i>. If you have text in this format in the clipboard, you can use the <b>Paste</b> button to input the entire reference directly, otherwise use <b>New</b> and fill in the four fields. Use <b>Edit</b> to change an existing reference.
<h3><a name="annotate"></a>Annotate</h3>
<p>Annotations on a CDD are linked to columns in the alignment, such as columns
  of conserved residues at an active site. To create a new annotation, highlight
  the desired columns in the sequence viewer (or highlight residues of the master
  sequence), and click on <b>New</b> in the box on the left and enter a description;
  available annotations will be listed above. Clicking <b>Edit</b> will let you
  change the description of the selected annotation, and optionally change the
  column location of that annotation. <b>Highlight</b> will cause the columns
  of that annotation to be highlighted in the sequence viewer, and <b>Delete</b>
  removes the annotation completely. </p>
<p>Each annotation can have evidence associated with it - for example, a literature
  reference that describes in more detail the conservation of the active site.
  Select an annotation in the list on the left, and then click <b>New</b> to create
  a new evidence item. There are currently three types of evidence: a text comment,
  a literature reference (PubMed ID), or &quot;Structure&quot; - which can be
  any set of residues and molecules (including solvents and heterogens) from a
  single PDB that illustrate a specific case of the conserved feature annotated
  for the whole CDD family. Clicking <b>Show</b> will display the selected evidence
  item, <b>Edit</b> will let you change it, and <b>Delete</b> will remove it.
  <b>Move up/down</b> lets you change the ordering of the evidence items.</p>
<h3><a name="reject"></a>Reject Sequence</h3>
<p>This brings up a list of all sequences present in both alignment and import
windows. You can choose to add any sequence to the CDD's reject list, which will
cue the update system to not include the sequence in any subsequent updates, so
<b>use with caution</b>! You can also optionally remove the sequence from the
alignment and import windows.</p>
<h3><a name="show"></a>Show rejects</h3>
Writes a list of rejected sequences to the message log window.
