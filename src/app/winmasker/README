ABSTRACT

    WindowMasker is a program that identifies and masks out highly 
    repetitive DNA sequences and DNA sequences with low complexity 
    in a genome using only the sequence of the genome itself.
    WindowMasker is described in [1]. Please cite this paper in
    any publication that uses WindowMasker.

DESCRIPTION

    WindowMasker has two modules for masking DNA sequences.  The 
    WinMask module is used to mask potentially repetitive sequences 
    by counting the number of times different n-mers (units) occur 
    in the genome. The DUST module is used to identify and mask low-
    complexity regions.

    The WinMask module works in two stages. During Stage 1, unit 
    counts are collected and stored in a separate file. During 
    Stage 2 that file is used to mask the input sequences. Usually 
    the unit counts file is created once per genome and then used
    multiple times for masking.

    Stage 1 is selected with "-mk_counts true" command line option
    (this option is set to "false" by default). Stage 1 processes
    input data in up to 4 passes.

        Pass 1 (optional). Checking for long possibly duplicate 
        sequences in the input. This pass is made when 
        "-checkdup true" is selected.

        Pass 2 (optional). Compute the total size in bases (bp) of 
        the genome.  This pass is made when neither unit length 
        ("-unit") nor the genome size ("-genome_size") are given on 
        the command line. Knowledge of genome size is necessary to 
        compute the unit length automatically.

        Pass 3 (optional). Compute unit score thresholds T_threshold, 
        T_extend, T_low, and T_high. In particular the value of 
        T_low is necessary for the final pass to save only the counts 
        for the units with score above T_low. This pass can be 
        avoided by using "-t_low" command line option that explicitly 
        sets the value of T_low.

        Pass 4. Generate the file containing the unit length, 
        significant (above T_low) unit counts, and threshold values.
        
    Stage 2 corresponds to "-mk_counts false", which is the default.
    WindowMasker reads the data generated in Stage 1 and a set of 
    input DNA sequences to output information about masked 
    subintervals. If "-dust true" is specified, then the DUST module
    is applied to the input sequences in addition to window based
    masking. When DUST module is run, the results of the DUST and 
    WinMask modules are merged together in the output. Specifically, 
    a base is masked if it is masked by either DUST or by WinMask.


OPTIONS

    In this section, command line options to WindowMasker are 
    explained. There are two subsections for Stage 1 options and 
    Stage 2 options. Some options are applicable in both stages 
    but could have somewhat different meaning.

Common Options

    -mk_counts true/false

        Default: false

        Select the mode of operation of WindowMasker. The value of 
        true selects Stage 1 processing, e.g. creation of unit counts 
        and computation of threshold parameters.  The value of false 
        (default) selects Stage 2 processing, e.g. sequence masking.

    -exclude_ids exclude_id_list

        default: <empty>

        The name of the file containing the list of sequence ids (one 
        per line) in the input that should not be processed.  See 
        section FILES for an example. This option and "-ids" option 
        are mutually exclusive.

    -ids id_list

        default: <empty>

        The name of the file containing the list of sequence ids (one 
        per line) in the input that should be processed. See section 
        FILES for an example. This option and "-exclude_ids" option 
        are mutually exclusive.

Stage 1 Options

    -checkdup true/false

        default: false

        If the value is true, then a pass is made to check the input 
        for long possibly duplicate sequences. The algorithm is 
        heuristic. For a pair of sequences a match is reported if at 
        least 5 100 bp segments approximately 10000 bp apart match 
        exactly. "Approximately" above means that some fuzziness is 
        allowed in the distance between consecutive 100 bp segments. 
        This criterion will detect all duplicates as well as some 
        false positives. In our experience, duplicates arise when 
        multiple, distinct assemblies of some part (e.g., one 
        chromosome) of the genome pieces are considered as part of 
        the sequenced genome.

    -fa_list true/false

        default: false

        If the value of this parameter is true, then "-input" option
        specifies a file containing a list of pathnames (one pathname
        per line) to the FASTA formatted files that will be used as 
        input. Otherwise "-input" option specifies a single FASTA
        formatted file.

    -genome_size genome_size

        default: <empty>

        Explicitly specify the genome length in number of bases.  If 
        this parameter is not used then the genome length is computed 
        as the sum of lengths of all input sequences.  This parameter 
        does not have any effect if "-unit" option is specified. 
        Otherwise it is used to compute the unit length.

    -input input_file_name

        default: <empty>

        The location of the input file. The contents of the input 
        file depends on the value of "-fa_list" option. If "-fa_list 
        false" is specified, input file is a single FASTA formatted 
        file. Unit counts will be generated based on the sequences 
        in that file.  If "-fa_list true" is specified, then input 
        file contains a list of pathnames (one per line) of FASTA 
        formatted files that form the genome. In this case unit 
        counts will be generated based on all the sequences contained 
        in the listed files.

    -mem available_memory

        default: 1536

        Assume that this much RAM is available for WindowMasker.  The 
        value is in megabytes. Depending on the amount of available 
        memory, passes 3 and 4 of stage 2 could contain additional 
        subpasses.  This is especially true for large (>=14) values 
        of unit length.

    -output output_file_name

        default: <stdout>

        The location of the output file. This parameter is optional
        and standard output is used if it is not specified.  Section 
        FILES contains the description of format of the file.

    -sformat unit_counts_format

        default: ascii

        The format in which the unit counts data should be generated.
        The possible values are "ascii" and "binary". The former makes
        windowmasker generate unit counts in human readable text form,
        which is highly portable but slow to load during Stage 2.
        The binary format is not portable but loads very fast.

    -t_low T_low

        default: <empty>
        
        Save only information about units with counts equal or bigger
        than T_low. If "-t_low" is not specified on command line, then
        its value is computed so that 90% of all units present in the 
        genome have counts below T_low.

    -unit unit_length

        default: <empty>

        Specifies the unit length to use. The value is an integer 
        between 1 and 16. If this parameter is not specified then
        unit length is computed automatically from the genome length 
        L in bases as the smallest number N such that L/4^N > 5.

Stage 2 Options

    -dust true/false

        default: false

        Use the DUST module in addition to the WinMask module to mask 
        out low-complexity regions.

    -input input_file_name

        default: <stdin>

        Specifies the input file for masking. WindowMasker accepts 
        input in FASTA format. If this option is skipped, then the 
        standard input will be used as the source of input. 

    -oformat output_format

        default: interval

        The possible values are "interval" and "fasta". If "fasta" 
        is selected the output is a FASTA formatted file with masked 
        regions in lower case letters. If the interval format is 
        selected the output is a file containing, for each processed 
        sequence, a sorted set of continuous masked subsequences.  
        For the format of the intervals file see section FILES.  
        [NOTE: Case of the input does not matter. All input sequences 
        are considered unmasked and window masker does not preserve 
        the case of the input.]

    -output output_file_name

        default: <stdout>

        Specifies the output file. The output file format depends on
        the value of "-oformat" option. If this option is skipped,
        then the standard output will be used as the output file
        descriptor.

    -set_t_high score

        default: T_high

        The score value for units with unit count above T_high.
        See [1] for details.

    -set_t_low score

        default: (T_low + 1)/2

        The score value for units with unit count below T_low.
        See [1] for details.

    -t_extend T_extend

        default: <the value from unit counts file>

        This parameter defines whether the interval between two
        windows with score higher than T_threshold is masked. The
        interval will be masked if every base of the interval lies 
        within a window of score greater or equal than T_extend.  For 
        the definition of the window score see description of 
        "-window_size" option. This parameter overrides the value
        contained in the unit counts file.

    -t_high T_high

        default: <the value from unit counts file>

        This parameter overrides the value contained in the unit
        counts file. Units with counts greater than T_high will not 
        be read from the unit_counts file and the value of
        "-set_t_high" will be used as the result of unit count lookup.

    -t_low T_low

        default: <the value from unit counts file>

        This parameter overrides the value contained in the unit
        counts file. Since the unit counts file does not keep counts
        of the units that appear fewer than T_low times in the
        genome, it only makes sense to specify a T_low value that is 
        greater than the one in the unit counts file. In that case 
        unit with counts that are less than T_low will not be read 
        from the unit counts file and the value of "-set_t_low" 
        option will be used as the result of unit count lookup.

    -t_thres T_threshold

        default: <the value from unit counts file>

        All windows with score above T_threshold are masked. For the
        definition of the window score see description of 
        "-window_size" option. This parameter overrides the value
        contained in the unit counts file.

    -ustat unit_counts

        This option is required for Stage 2 processing. It specifies
        the name of the file containing the unit counts for the
        genome in use. Unit counts are typically created during
        Stage 1 of WindowMasker processing. The format of the unit
        counts file is recognized automatically

    -window window_size

        default <use unit_size + 4>

        The WinMask module works by tracking the score of a sliding
        window which is defined as average of counts of all units 
        within the window. This parameter defines the size of the 
        sliding window. By default the value unit_size + 4 is used so 
        there are 5 units in a window.

FILES

    This section describes the file formats that are used by
    WindowMasker and provides some examples (FASTA file format is not 
    described here).


    Genome in multiple FASTA files

    If the genome data is contained in multiple FASTA formatted
    files, then "-fa_list true" should be used and the value of 
    "-input" option should name the file containing the list of the 
    required FASTA files, one file per line. For example, for human 
    genome build 34, one could have one FASTA file per chromosome 
    named chrX.fa, chrY.fa, chr1.fa, chr2.fa, ..., chr22.fa located 
    in the /human34 directory. Then the file given to the "-input" 
    option should look like this:

/human34/chr1.fa
/human34/chr2.fa
...
/human34/chr22.fa
/human34/chrX.fa
/human34/chrY.fa

    NOTE: Empty lines are ignored.


    Unit Counts

    This file is the output of WindowMasker Stage 1 processing.  The 
    file is an ASCII text file. It also serves as input for Stage 2 
    processing. When WindowMasker reads the unit counts file during 
    Stage 2 empty lines and lines starting with '#' character are 
    ignored. This way comments could be introduced into the unit 
    counts file.

    The first line of the file contains one integer number which is 
    the unit size.

    Then come the lines containing counts for the units which
    appeared more than T_low times in the genome (and its reverse 
    complement). These are ordered by the unit numerical value. Each 
    line has the following structure:

                    UNIT_VALUE COUNT

    where UNIT_VALUE is an integer in hexadecimal format and COUNT is 
    a decimal integer.

    The last section of the file contains the computed values for 
    T_threshold, T_extend, T_low, and T_high, each on a separate line 
    with the following structure:

                    >PARAM_NAME VALUE

    where PARAM_NAME is one of t_low, t_extend, t_threshold, t_high 
    and VALUE is the integer value of the corresponding parameter.

    For example the unit counts file for human build 34 looks like 
    this (only 20 lines in the beginning and 5 lines in the end are 
    shown):

>t_low       16
>t_extend    57
>t_threshold 86
>t_high      154


    List of Sequence Ids to Process
    List of Sequence Ids to Exclude from Processing

    Both files have identical format. WindowMasker uses the first 
    word of the sequence FASTA title (with or without the leading 
    '>' character) as the sequence id. There should be one sequence 
    id per line. Below is an example of such a file.

gi|20349357|ref|NT_033777.1|
>gi|20340552|ref|NT_033778.1|


    WindowMasker Interval Output Format

    By default the output of WindowMasker Stage 2 is in Interval
    format ("-oformat interval"). The file is an ASCII text file
    consisting of blocks of information for each input sequence in 
    the order those sequences appear in the input FASTA file.  Each 
    block starts with the FASTA title of the sequence followed by the 
    description of masked intervals, one interval per line. The 
    intervals do not overlap and are sorted by their start position. 
    (NOTE: the positions are numbered starting at 0.) Each line 
    describing a masked interval has the following structure:

                        START - END

    where START and END are decimal integers representing the end 
    points of the masked interval. Below is sample part of 
    WindowMasker output in interval format:

SAMPLE WINDOWMASKER SESSION

    Assuming the list of genome files for human build 34 are in the 
    file ./fa_list the following command will run the first stage of 
    WindowMasker. Checking for duplicates is requested, so all 
    candidates for duplicates will be reported on standard error 
    (stderr). The possible duplicates reported below turn out to be 
    false positives. During Stage 1, WindowMasker also shows the 
    progress by printing dots to standard error (stderr).


./windowmasker -mk_counts true -fa_list true -input fa_list -checkdup true -output ustat.15
