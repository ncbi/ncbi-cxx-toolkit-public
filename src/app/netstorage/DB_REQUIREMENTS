The code requires the following DB side components:
- Database structure: version 5
- Stored procedures: version 11

To check the DB versions please use the following request:
SELECT * FROM Versions

If the versions in your DB do not match the required versions please update the
database using the appropriate .sql scripts in this directory.
Note: the .sql scripts only allow to move the DB forward.
