; jobs in the queue)

; This parameter protects from application hang ups (infinit loop)
;

; time in seconds to send notification message to the queue server, that
; job is still running. This parameter protects from hardware failures,
; so if worker node crashes the job is rescheduled by the queue

; Specifies an action if the applicaion returns none zero code. 
; Available actions: done - the job will be marked as done
;                    fail - the job will be marked as failed with retcode error message
;                    return - the job will be returned back to the queue
; Default is done 
;non_zero_exit_action = fail

; Specifies if the remote application should be run from a separate directory
; for each job. In this case before the application is started a new directory
; with the name <JOB_KEY> is created and when the application finishes this 
; directory gets automatically deleted.
; Default is false.

; Specifies a job's execution monitor application. This application can be used 
; to gather a progress report or to check if the job application is really doing 
; some task  or it hung up for some reasons. 
; It runs periodically during a real application execution. 
; Parameters which are passed to a monitor script:
;  -pid pid  - real application process id
;  -jid jid  - job id which the real application is processing.
;Monitor's exit code interpretation:
;   0: the job is running ok. The monitor's stdout goes as a progress message 
;      to the client, and stderr goes to the log file if the logging is request 
;      for this node.
;   1: something wrong with the job and it should be retuned back to the queue. 
;      The monitor's stderr goes to the log file unconditionally.
;   2: something wrong with the job and it should fail. The monitor's stdout goes
;      as a failure error message, and stderr goes to the log file unconditionally.
;   3: something wrong with the monitor application. The job continues executing. 
;      The monitor's stderr goes to the log file unconditionally.
