-- GC-Sequence:
-- Used for scaffolds, scaffold-sets and components in Gencoll terminology.
-- Theoretically can support sequences decsribed with more levels than
-- Chromosome / scaffold-set/scaffold/component.
-- The meaning of the GC-Sequence record - if it is component, scaffold or 
-- or scaffold-set, is defined by its context.
-- ??? DO WE NEED A FIELD TO SPECIFY WHAT LEVEL IT IS???
--
-- GC-Sequences are made of GC-Sequences: At the lowest level there is only one
-- seq-id of a component with no further structure.
GC-Sequence ::= SEQUENCE {
